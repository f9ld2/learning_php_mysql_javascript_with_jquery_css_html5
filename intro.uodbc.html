   In addition to normal ODBC support, the Unified ODBC functions in
   PHP allow you to access several databases that have borrowed the
   semantics of the ODBC API to implement their own API.  Instead of
   maintaining multiple database drivers that were all nearly
   identical, these drivers have been unified into a single set of
   ODBC functions.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The following databases are supported by the Unified ODBC
   functions: <a href="http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/adabas_2010/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;Adabas D</a>,
   <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;IBM DB2</a>,
   <a href="http://www.iodbc.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;iODBC</a>,
   <a href="http://www.solidtech.com/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;Solid</a>, and

    With the exception of iODBC, there is no ODBC involved when 
    connecting to the above databases. The functions that you 
    use to speak natively to them just happen to share the same 
    names and syntax as the ODBC functions. However, building PHP 
    with iODBC support enables you to use any ODBC-compliant 
    drivers with your PHP applications. More information on iODBC,
    is available at <a href="http://www.iodbc.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;www.iodbc.org</a>
    with the alternative unixODBC available at
