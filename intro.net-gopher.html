  <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="simpara">
   The gopher protocol, as defined by <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1436" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;RFC 1436</a>,
   is generally considered the ancestor of the modern HTTP protocol.
   However, gopher was also intended to provide references to non-gopher
   resources including telnet, wais, nntp, and even http. This extension
   adds gopher support to PHP&apos;s <a href="wrappers.html" class="link">URL Wrappers</a>,
   and provides a helper function <span class="function"><a href="function.gopher-parsedir.html" class="function">gopher_parsedir()</a></span> to
   make sense of gopher formatted directory listings.
