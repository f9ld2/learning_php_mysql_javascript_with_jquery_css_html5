implementing dynamic sparse arrays.

   <p class="para">
A Judy array is a complex but very fast associative array data structure for 
storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. Unlike normal 
arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse; that is, they may have large ranges of 
unassigned indices.

   <p class="para">
A Judy array consumes memory only when populated yet can grow to take advantage 
of all available memory.  Judy&apos;s key benefits are:  scalability, performance, 
memory efficiency, and ease of use. Judy arrays are designed to grow without 
tuning into the peta-element range, scaling near O(log-base-256) -- 1 more RAM 
access at 256 X population.
