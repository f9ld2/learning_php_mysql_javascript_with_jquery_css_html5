   This extension requires the c-client library to be installed.
   Grab the latest version from <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/</a>
   and compile it.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   It&apos;s important that you do not copy the IMAP source files directly into
   the system include directory as there may be conflicts.  Instead, create
   a new directory inside the system include directory, such as 
   <var class="filename">/usr/local/imap-2000b/</var> (location and name
   depend on your setup and IMAP version), and inside this new 
   directory create additional directories named <var class="filename">lib/</var> 
   and <var class="filename">include/</var>.  From the <var class="filename">c-client</var> 
   directory from your IMAP source tree, copy all the <var class="filename">*.h</var> 
   files into <var class="filename">include/</var> and all the 
   <var class="filename">*.c</var> files into <var class="filename">lib/</var>.  
   Additionally when you compiled IMAP, a file named
   <var class="filename">c-client.a</var> was created.  Also put this in the 
   <var class="filename">lib/</var> directory but rename it as
   <var class="filename">libc-client.a</var>.

    To build the c-client library with SSL or/and Kerberos support read
    the docs supplied with the package.

  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
   <span class="simpara">
    In Mandrake Linux, the IMAP library (<var class="filename">libc-client.a</var>)
    is compiled without Kerberos support. A separate version with SSL
    (<var class="filename">client-PHP4.a</var>) is installed. The library must
    be recompiled in order to add Kerberos support.
