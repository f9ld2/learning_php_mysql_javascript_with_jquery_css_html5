      First one and also the default one is using the mqic libraries. Compiling and linking the
      extension against these IBM WebSphere MQSeries libraries allows the extension to connect to the
      Queue manager using the client interface. Remote connections are possible this way.
     </p>
    </li> 
    <li class="listitem">
     <p class="para">The other way is to compile and link against the mqm libraries. Using these libraries it is 
     possible to make use of the transaction management of a queue manager.</p>
