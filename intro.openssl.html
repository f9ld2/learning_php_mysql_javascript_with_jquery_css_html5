  <p class="para">
   This module uses the functions of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;OpenSSL</a> for generation and verification
   of signatures and for sealing (encrypting) and opening (decrypting)
   data. OpenSSL offers many features that this module currently doesn&apos;t
   support. Some of these may be added in the future.
