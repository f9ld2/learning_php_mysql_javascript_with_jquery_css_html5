   Mailparse is an extension for parsing and working with email messages.
   It can deal with <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;RFC 822</a> and <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;RFC 2045</a> (<em>MIME</em>) compliant
   messages.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Mailparse is stream based, which means that it does not keep in-memory
   copies of the files it processes - so it is very resource efficient when
   dealing with large messages.

   </p><p class="para">
    Mailparse requires the <a href="book.mbstring.html" class="link">mbstring</a>
    extension, and mbstring must be loaded before mailparse.

  <p class="para">
   This extension has been moved to the
<a href="http://pecl.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;PECL</a> repository and is no longer bundled with
PHP as of PHP 4.2.0.
