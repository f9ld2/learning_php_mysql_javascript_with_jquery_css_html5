   PHP supports the direct io functions as described in the Posix
   Standard (Section 6) for performing I/O functions at a lower
   level than the C-Language stream I/O functions
   (<span class="function"><a href="function.fopen.html" class="function">fopen()</a></span>, <span class="function"><a href="function.fread.html" class="function">fread()</a></span>,..).  The use
   of the DIO functions should be considered only when direct 
   control of a device is needed.  In all other cases, the standard
   <a href="book.filesystem.html" class="link">filesystem</a> functions are more
   than adequate.
