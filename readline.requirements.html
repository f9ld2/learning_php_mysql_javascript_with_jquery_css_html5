   To use the readline functions, you need to install libreadline. You can
   find libreadline on the home page of the GNU Readline project, at
   <a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html</a>.
   It&apos;s maintained by Chet Ramey, who&apos;s also the author of Bash.

   You can also use these functions with the libedit library, a non-GPL
   replacement for the readline library. The libedit library is BSD
   licensed and available for download from
