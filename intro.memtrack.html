  <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="para">
   The purpose of this extension is to detect the most memory hungry scripts
   and functions.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   memtrack tracks memory consumption in PHP scripts and produces reports 
   (warnings) when the consumption reaches certain levels set by the user.
   This is achieved by replacing default executor function by a special 
   function which compares memory usage before and after running the 
   original executor - this way we can tell how much the memory usage 
   has changed during the execution of the current part of the code.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Zend Engine runs its executor for each opcode array (op_array), 
   which usually means function, plain script and such, so memtrack doesn&apos;t
   have any noticeable effect on performance.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   memtrack doesn&apos;t provide any functions, there are only INI directives which
   allow you to configure the way it should work.
  </p>
