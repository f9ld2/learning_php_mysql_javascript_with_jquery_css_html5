   This module contains an interface to the GNU Recode library. The GNU
   Recode library converts files between various coded character sets and
   surface encodings. When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid
   of the offending characters or fall back on approximations. The library
   recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
   convert files between almost any pair. Most

   supported.
