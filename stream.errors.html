 <h1>Stream Errors</h1>

 <p class="para">
  As with any file or socket related function, an operation on a stream
  may fail for a variety of normal reasons (i.e.: Unable to connect to remote
  host, file not found, etc...).  A stream related call may also fail because
  the desired stream is not registered on the running system.  See the array returned
  by <span class="function"><a href="function.stream-get-wrappers.html" class="function">stream_get_wrappers()</a></span> for a list of streams supported by your
  installation of PHP.  As with most PHP internal functions
  if a failure occurs an <strong><code>E_WARNING</code></strong> message will be generated
  describing the nature of the error.
