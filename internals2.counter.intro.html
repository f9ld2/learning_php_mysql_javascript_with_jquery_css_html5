     The &quot;counter&quot; extension provides any number of counters to PHP code using it
     which reset at times determined by the caller.
    </p>
   
    <p class="simpara">
     There are three interfaces to &quot;counter&quot;: basic, extended, and objective. The
     basic interface provides a single counter controlled by INI settings and
     function calls. The extended interface provides an arbitrary number of named
     counter resources which may optionally persist beyond the lifetime of a
     single PHP request. The objective interface combines both the basic and
     extended interfaces into a <strong class="classname">Counter</strong> class.
