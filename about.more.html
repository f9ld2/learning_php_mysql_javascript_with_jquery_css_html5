  <p class="para">
   This manual does not attempt to provide instruction about general
   programming practices. First-time - or even just beginning -
   programmers may find it difficult to learn how to program in PHP using
   this manual exclusively. Instead, seek out a text more oriented towards
   beginners.

  <p class="para">
   There are a number of active mailing lists for discussion on all aspects of
   programming with PHP. If stuck with a problem, consider using these lists.
   For support options, including mailing lists, view <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;the PHP.net support page</a>.
