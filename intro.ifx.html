  <p class="para">
   The Informix driver for Informix (IDS) 7.x, SE 7.x, Universal
   Server (IUS) 9.x and IDS 2000 is implemented in &quot;ifx.ec&quot; and
   &quot;php_informix.h&quot; in the informix extension directory.  IDS 7.x support
   is fairly complete, with full support for BYTE and TEXT
   columns. IUS 9.x support is partly finished: the new data types
   are there, but SLOB and CLOB support is still under construction.
