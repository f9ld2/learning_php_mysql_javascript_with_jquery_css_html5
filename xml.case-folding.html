 <h1>Case Folding</h1>

 <p class="para">
  The element handler functions may get their element names
  <span class="glossterm">case-folded</span>.  Case-folding is defined 
  as &quot;a process applied to a sequence of
  characters, in which those identified as non-uppercase are
  replaced by their uppercase equivalents&quot;.  In other words, when
  it comes to XML, case-folding simply means uppercasing.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  By default, all the element names that are passed to the handler
  functions are case-folded.  This behaviour can be queried and
  controlled per XML parser with the
  <span class="function"><a href="function.xml-parser-get-option.html" class="function">xml_parser_get_option()</a></span> and
  <span class="function"><a href="function.xml-parser-set-option.html" class="function">xml_parser_set_option()</a></span> functions,
  respectively.
