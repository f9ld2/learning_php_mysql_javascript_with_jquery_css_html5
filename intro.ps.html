   This module allows to create PostScript documents. It has many
   similarities with the pdf extension. Actually the API is almost
   identical and one can in many cases just replace the prefix of
   each function from pdf_ to ps_. This also works for functions which
   has no meaning in the PostScript document (like adding hyperlinks)
   but will have an effect if the document is converted to PDF.

  <p class="para">Documents created by this extension are sometimes even superior
   to documents created with the pdf extension, because pslib&apos;s text
   rendering functions can handle kerning, hyphenation and ligatures
   which results in much better output of boxed text.
