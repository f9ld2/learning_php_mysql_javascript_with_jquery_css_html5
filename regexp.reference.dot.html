  <h2 class="title">Dot</h2>
  <p class="para">
   Outside a character class, a dot in the pattern matches  any
   one  character  in  the  subject,  including  a non-printing
   character, but not (by default) newline.  If the
   <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOTALL</a>
   option  is  set,  then dots match newlines as well. The
   handling of dot is entirely independent of the handling of
   circumflex  and  dollar,  the only relationship being that they
   both involve newline characters.  Dot has no special meaning
   in a character class.

  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">\C</em> can be used to match single byte. It makes sense
   in <em class="emphasis">UTF-8 mode</em> where full stop matches the whole
   character which can consist of multiple bytes.
