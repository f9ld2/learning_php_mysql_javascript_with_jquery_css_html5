  <h2 class="title">Tar-based phars</h2>
  <p class="para">
   Archives based on the tar file format follow the more modern USTAR
   file format.  The design of the tar file header makes them more efficient
   to access than the zip file format, and almost as efficient as the phar
   file format.  File names are limited to 255 bytes, including
   full path within the phar archive.  There is no limit on the number of files
   within a tar-based phar archive.  These archives can fully compressed in
   gzip or bzip2 format and still be executed by the Phar extension.
