  <h2 class="title">Books about PHP</h2>
  <p class="para">
   As PHP grew, it began to be recognized as a world-wide popular
   development platform. One of the most interesting ways of
   seeing this trend was by observing the books about PHP that
   came out throughout the years.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   To the best of our knowledge, the first book dedicated to PHP was
   &apos;PHP - tvorba interaktivn&#xED;ch internetov&#xFD;ch aplikac&#xED;&apos; (<em class="emphasis">PHP
   - Creating Interactive Internet Applications</em>) - a Czech
   book published in April 1999, authored by Jirka Kosek. Next month
   followed a German book authored by Egon Schmid, Christian Cartus
   and Richard Blume. The first book in English about PHP was
   published shortly afterwards, and was &apos;Core PHP Programming&apos; by
   Leon Atkinson. These books covered PHP 3.0.

  <p class="para">
   While these books were the first of their kind - they were
   followed by a large number of books from a host of authors and
   publishers. There are over 400 books in English, over 100 books in
   German, and over 50 books in French or Spanish! In addition, you
   can find books about PHP in many other languages, including
   Korean, Japanese and Hebrew.

  <p class="para">
   Clearly, this large number of books, written by different
   authors, published by many publishers, and their availability
   in so many languages - are a strong testimony for PHP&apos;s
   world-wide success.
