  <h2 class="title">Requirements</h2>
  <p class="para"> 
   If you want to use SCA to consume or produce Web services then you
   need PHP 5.2.0 or later, built with the soap extension enabled. If you
   just want to use local components, and do not wish to use the Web
   service bindings, then this version of SCA for PHP will also run with
   PHP 5.1.6.
  </p>
  <p class="para"> 
   SCA is packaged along with SDO in one combined package on PECL.
   See http://www.php.net/sdo#sdo.installation for installing the
   SCA_SDO package from PECL. The SCA code must be on the include path of
   your PHP installation, for example if it is installed as
   /usr/local/lib/php/SCA, the include_path directive must include
   /usr/local/lib/php
