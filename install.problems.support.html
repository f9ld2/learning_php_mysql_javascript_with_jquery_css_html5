    <p class="simpara">
     If you are still stuck, someone on the PHP installation mailing list may be
     able to help you. You should check out the archive first, in case
     someone already answered someone else who had the same problem as
     you. The archives are available from the support page on <a href="http://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://www.php.net/support.php</a>. To subscribe to the PHP installation
     mailing list, send an empty mail to <a href="mailto:php-install-subscribe@lists.php.net" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;php-install-subscribe@lists.php.net</a>.
     The mailing list address is <a href="mailto:php-install@lists.php.net" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;php-install@lists.php.net</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="simpara">
     If you want to get help on the mailing list, please try to be
     precise and give the necessary details about your environment
     (which operating system, what PHP version, what web server, if
     you are running PHP as CGI or a server module, <a href="ini.sect.safe-mode.html#ini.safe-mode" class="link">safe mode</a>, etc.), and
     preferably enough code to make others able to reproduce and test
     your problem.
    </p>
