 <p class="para">
  To build the ibm_db2 extension, the DB2 application development header
  files and libraries must be installed on your system. DB2 does not install
  these by default, so you may have to return to your DB2 installer and add
  this option. The header files are included with the DB2 Application
  Development Client freely available for download from the IBM DB2 Universal
  Database <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/db2/udb/support/downloadv8.html" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;support site</a>.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  If you add the DB2 application development header files and libraries to
  a Linux or Unix operating system on which DB2 was already installed, you
  must issue the command <strong class="command">db2iupdt -e</strong> to update the symbolic
  links to the header files and libraries in your DB2 instances.

 <p class="para">
  ibm_db2 is a  <a href="http://pecl.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;PECL</a> extension, so follow the
  instructions in <a href="install.pecl.html" class="xref">Installation of PECL extensions</a> to install the ibm_db2
  extension for PHP. Issue the <strong class="command">configure</strong> command to point
  to the location of your DB2 header files and libraries as follows:
  <div class="example-contents screen">
<div class="cdata"><pre>
bash$ ./configure --with-IBM_DB2=/path/to/DB2
</pre></div>
  </div>
  The <strong class="command">configure</strong> command defaults to
  <var class="filename">/opt/IBM/db2/V8.1</var>.
