  LDAP support in PHP is not enabled by default. You will need to
  use the <strong class="option configure">--with-ldap[=DIR]</strong>

  configuration option when compiling PHP to enable LDAP support.
  DIR is the LDAP base install directory. To enable SASL support,
  be sure <strong class="option configure">--with-ldap-sasl[=DIR]</strong>
 is
  used, and that <var class="filename">sasl.h</var> exists on the system.
