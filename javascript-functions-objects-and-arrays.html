<h2>JavaScript Functions, Objects, and Arrays</h2>
<span>Just like PHP, JavaScript offers access to functions and objects. In fact, JavaScript is actually based on objects, because&mdash;as you&rsquo;ve seen&mdash;it has to access the DOM, which makes every element of an HTML document available to manipulate as an object.</span>
<br/>
<span>The usage and syntax are also quite similar to those of PHP, so you should feel right at home as I take you through using functions and objects in JavaScript, as well as through an in-depth exploration of array handling.</span>
<h3>JavaScript Functions</h3>
<span>In addition to having access to dozens of built-in functions (or methods) such as write , which you have already seen being used in document.write , you can easily create your own functions. Whenever you have a more complex piece of code that is likely to be reused, you have a candidate for a function.</span>
<h4>Defining a Function</h4>
<span>The general syntax for a function is shown here:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
function function_name([parameter[, ...]])
{
    statements
}
</code>
</pre>
<span>The first line of the syntax indicates the following:</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; A definition starts with the word function .</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; A name follows that must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, digits, dollar symbols, or underscores.</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; The parentheses are required.</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; One or more parameters, separated by commas, are optional (indicated by the square brackets, which are not part of the function syntax).</span>
<br/>
<span>Function names are case-sensitive, so all of the following strings refer to different functions: getInput , GETINPUT , and getinput .</span>
<br/>
<span>In JavaScript there is a general naming convention for functions: the first letter of each word in a name is capitalized except for the very first letter, which is lowercase. Therefore, of the previous examples, getInput would be the preferred name used by most programmers. This convention is commonly referred to as bumpyCaps , bumpyCase , or camelCase .</span>
<br/>
<span>The opening curly brace starts the statements that will execute when you call the function; a matching curly brace must close it. These statements may include one or more return statements, which force the function to cease execution and return to the calling code. If a value is attached to the return statement, the calling code can retrieve it.</span>
<br/>
<span>The arguments array</span>
<br/>
<span>The arguments array is a member of every function. With it, you can determine the number of variables passed to a function and what they are. Take the example of a function called displayItems . Example 15-1 shows one way of writing it.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-1. Defining a function</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    displayItems("Dog", "Cat", "Pony", "Hamster", "Tortoise")
    
    function displayItems(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5)
    {
        document.write(v1 + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write(v2 + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write(v3 + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write(v4 + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write(v5 + "&lt;br&gt;")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>When you call up this script in your browser, it will display the following:</span>
<br/>
<span>Dog Cat Pony Hamster Tortoise</span>
<br/>
<span>All of this is fine, but what if you wanted to pass more than five items to the function? Also, reusing the document.write call multiple times instead of employing a loop is wasteful programming. Luckily, the arguments array gives you the flexibility to handle a variable number of arguments. &nbsp;Example 15-2 &nbsp;shows how you can use it to rewrite the example in a much more efficient manner.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-2. Modifying the function to use the arguments array</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    function displayItems()
    {
        for (j = 0 ; j &lt; displayItems.arguments.length ; ++j)
            document.write(displayItems.arguments[j] + "&lt;br&gt;")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Note the use of the length property, which you already encountered in the previous chapter, and also how the array displayItems.arguments is referenced using the variable j as an offset into it. I also chose to keep the function short and sweet by not surrounding the contents of the for loop in curly braces, as it contains only a single statement.</span>
<br/>
<span>Using this technique, you now have a function that can take as many (or as few) arguments as you like and act on each argument as you desire.</span>
<h4>Returning a Value</h4>
<span>Functions are not used just to display things. In fact, they are mostly used to perform calculations or data manipulation and then return a result. The function fixNames in Example 15-3 uses the arguments array (discussed in the previous section) to take a series of strings passed to it and return them as a single string. The &ldquo;fix&rdquo; it performs is to convert every character in the arguments to lowercase except for the first character of each argument, which is set to a capital letter.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-3. Cleaning up a full name</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    document.write(fixNames("the", "DALLAS", "CowBoys"))
    
    function fixNames()
    {
        var s = ""
        for (j = 0 ; j &lt; fixNames.arguments.length ; ++j)
            s += fixNames.arguments[j].charAt(0).toUpperCase() +
                 fixNames.arguments[j].substr(1).toLowerCase() + " "
        
        return s.substr(0, s.length-1)
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>When called with the parameters the , DALLAS , and CowBoys , for example, the function returns the string The Dallas Cowboys . Let&rsquo;s walk through the function.</span>
<br/>
<span>The function first initializes the temporary (and local) variable s to the empty string. Then a for loop iterates through each of the passed parameters, isolating the parameter&rsquo;s first character using the charAt method and converting it to uppercase with the toUpperCase method. The various methods shown in this example are all built into JavaScript and available by default.</span>
<br/>
<span>Then the substr method is used to fetch the rest of each string, which is converted to lowercase using the toLowerCase method. A fuller version of the substr method here would specify how many characters are part of the substring as a second argument:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">substr(1, (arguments[j].length) - 1 )</code></pre>
<span>In other words, this substr method says, &ldquo;Start with the character at position 1 (the second character) and return the rest of the string (the length minus one).&rdquo; As a nice touch, though, the substr method assumes that you want the rest of the string if you omit the second argument.</span>
<br/>
<span>After the whole argument is converted to our desired case, a space character is added to the end and the result is appended to the temporary variable s .</span>
<br/>
<span>Finally, the substr method is used again to return the contents of the variable s , except for the final space&mdash;which is unwanted. We remove this by using substr to return the string up to, but not including, the final character.</span>
<br/>
<span>This example is particularly interesting in that it illustrates the use of multiple properties and methods in a single expression. For example:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">fixNames.arguments[j].substr(1).toLowerCase()</code></pre>
<span>You have to interpret the statement by mentally dividing it into parts at the periods.</span>
<br/>
<span>JavaScript evaluates these elements of the statement from left to right as follows:</span>
<br/>
<span>1. Start with the name of the function itself: fixNames .</span>
<br/>
<span>2. Extract element j from the array arguments representing fixNames arguments.</span>
<br/>
<span>3. Invoke substr with a parameter of 1 to the extracted element. This passes all but the first character to the next section of the expression.</span>
<br/>
<span>4. Apply the method toLowerCase to the string that has been passed this far.</span>
<br/>
<span>This practice is often referred to as &nbsp;method chaining . So, for example, if the string mixedCASE is passed to the example expression, it will go through the following transformations:</span>
<br/>
<span class="t30">mixedCASE</span><br/>
<span class="t30">ixedCASE</span><br/>
<span class="t30">ixedcase</span>
<br/>
<span>One final reminder: the s variable created inside the function is local, and therefore cannot be accessed outside the function. By returning s in the return statement, we made its value available to the caller, which could store or use it any way it wanted. But s itself disappears at the end of the function. Although we could make a function operate on global variables (and sometimes that&rsquo;s necessary), it&rsquo;s much better to just return the values you want to preserve and let JavaScript clean up all the other variables used by the function.</span>
<h4>Returning an Array</h4>
<span>In Example 15-3 , the function returned only one parameter, but what if you need to return multiple parameters? You can do this by returning an array, as in Example 15-4 .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-4. Returning an array of values</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    words = fixNames("the", "DALLAS", "CowBoys")
    for (j = 0 ; j &lt; words.length ; ++j)
        document.write(words[j] + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    function fixNames()
    {
        var s = new Array()
        for (j = 0 ; j &lt; fixNames.arguments.length ; ++j)
            s[j] = fixNames.arguments[j].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + 
                   fixNames.arguments[j].substr(1).toLowerCase()
        return s
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Here the variable words is automatically defined as an array and populated with the returned result of a call to the function fixNames . Then a for loop iterates through the array and displays each member.</span>
<br/>
<span>As for the fixNames function, it&rsquo;s almost identical to Example 15-3 , except that the variable s is now an array, and after each word has been processed, it is stored as an element of this array, which is returned by the return statement.</span>
<br/>
<span>This function enables the extraction of individual parameters from its returned values, like the following (the output from which is simply The Cowboys ):</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
words = fixNames("the", "DALLAS", "CowBoys")
document.write(words[0] + " " + words[2])
</code>
</pre>
<h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
<span>A JavaScript object is a step up from a variable, which can contain only one value at a time, in that objects can contain multiple values and even functions. An object groups data together with the functions needed to manipulate it.</span>
<h4>Declaring a Class</h4>
<span>When creating a script to use objects, you need to design a composite of data and code called a class . Each new object based on this class is called an instance (or occurrence ) of that class. As you&rsquo;ve already seen, the data associated with an object is called its properties , while the functions it uses are called methods .</span>
<br/>
<span>Let&rsquo;s look at how to declare the class for an object called User that will contain details about the current user. To create the class, just write a function named after the class. This function can accept arguments (I&rsquo;ll show later how it&rsquo;s invoked) and can create properties and methods for objects in that class. The function is called a constructor .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-5 shows a constructor for the class User with three properties: forename , username , and password . The class also defines the method showUser .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-5. Declaring the User class and its method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    function User(forename, username, password)
    {
        this.forename = forename
        this.username = username
        this.password = password
        
        this.showUser = function()
        {
            document.write("Forename: " + this.forename + "&lt;br&gt;")
            document.write("Username: " + this.username + "&lt;br&gt;")
            document.write("Password: " + this.password + "&lt;br&gt;")
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The function is different from other functions we&rsquo;ve seen so far in two ways:</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; It refers to an object named this . When the program creates an instance of User by running this function, this refers to the instance being created. The same function can be called over and over with different arguments, and will create a new User each time with different values for the properties forename , and so on.</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull; A new function named showUser is created within the function. The syntax shown here is new and rather complicated, but its purpose is to tie showUser to the User class. Thus, showUser comes into being as a method of the User class.</span>
<br/>
<span>The naming convention I have used is to keep all properties in lowercase and to use at least one uppercase character in method names, following the bumpyCaps convention mentioned earlier in the chapter.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-5 follows the recommended way to write a class constructor, which is to include methods in the constructor function. However, you can also refer to functions defined outside the constructor, as in Example 15-6 .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-6. Separately defining a class and method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    function User(forename, username, password)
    {
        this.forename = forename
        this.username = username
        this.password = password
        this.showUser = showUser
    }
    
    function showUser()
    {
        document.write("Forename: " + this.forename + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write("Username: " + this.username + "&lt;br&gt;")
        document.write("Password: " + this.password + "&lt;br&gt;")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>I show you this form because you are certain to encounter it when perusing other programmers&rsquo; code.</span>
<h4>Creating an Object</h4>
<span>To create an instance of the class User , you can use a statement such as the following:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">details = new User("Wolfgang", "w.a.mozart", "composer")</code></pre>
<span>Or you can create an empty object, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">details = new User()</code></pre>
<span>and then populate it later, like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
details.forename = "Wolfgang"
details.username = "w.a.mozart"
details.password = "composer"
</code>
</pre>
<span>You can also add new properties to an object, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">details.greeting = "Hello"</code></pre>
<span>You can verify that adding such new properties works with the following statement: document.write(details.greeting)</span>
<h4>Accessing Objects</h4>
<span>To access an object, you can refer to its properties, as in the following two unrelated example statements:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
name = details.forename
if (details.username == "Admin") loginAsAdmin()
</code>
</pre>
<span>So, to access the showUser method of an object of class User , you would use the following syntax, in which the object details has already been created and populated with data:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">details.showUser()</code></pre>
<span>Assuming the data supplied earlier, this code would display the following:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Forename: Wolfgang
Username: w.a.mozart
Password: composer
</code>
</pre>
<h4>The prototype Keyword</h4>
<span>The prototype keyword can save you a lot of memory. In the User class, every instance will contain the three properties and the method. Therefore, if you have 1,000 of these objects in memory, the method showUser will also be replicated 1,000 times. However, because the method is identical in every case, you can specify that new objects should refer to a single instance of the method instead of creating a copy of it. So, instead of using the following in a class constructor:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">this.showUser = function()</code></pre>
<span>you could replace it with this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">User.prototype.showUser = function()</code></pre>
<span>Example 15-7 shows what the new constructor would look like. Example 15-7. Declaring a class using the prototype keyword for a method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    function User(forename, username, password)
    {
        this.forename = forename
        this.username = username
        this.password = password
        
        User.prototype.showUser = function()
        {
            document.write("Forename: " + this.forename + "&lt;br&gt;")
            document.write("Username: " + this.username + "&lt;br&gt;")
            document.write("Password: " + this.password + "&lt;br&gt;")
        }
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>This works because all functions have a prototype property, designed to hold properties and methods that are not replicated in any objects created from a class. Instead, they are passed to its objects by reference.</span>
<br/>
<span>This means that you can add a prototype property or method at any time, and all objects (even those already created) will inherit it, as the following statements illustrate:</span>
<br/>
<span>User.prototype.greeting = "Hello" document.write(details.greeting)</span>
<br/>
<span>The first statement adds the prototype property of greeting with a value of Hello to the class User . In the second line, the object details , which has already been created, correctly displays this new property.</span>
<br/>
<span>You can also add to or modify methods in a class, as the following statements illustrate:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
User.prototype.showUser = function()
{
    document.write( "Name " + this.forename +
                    " User " + this.username +
                    " Pass " + this.password)
}
details.showUser()
</code>
</pre>
<span>You might add these lines to your script in a conditional statement (such as if ), so they run if user activities cause you to decide you need a different showUser method. After these lines run, even if the object details has been created already, further calls to details.showUser will run the new function. The old definition of showUser has been erased.</span>
<h6>Static methods and properties</h6>
<span>When reading about PHP objects, you learned that classes can have static properties and methods as well as properties and methods associated with a particular instance of a class. JavaScript also supports static properties and methods, which you can conveniently store and retrieve from the class&rsquo;s prototype . Thus, the following statements set and read a static string from User :</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
User.prototype.greeting = "Hello"
document.write(User.prototype.greeting)
</code>
</pre>
<h6>Extending JavaScript objects</h6>
<span>The prototype keyword even lets you add functionality to a built-in object. For example, suppose that you would like to add the ability to replace all spaces in a string with nonbreaking spaces in order to prevent it from wrapping around. You can do this by adding a prototype method to JavaScript&rsquo;s default String object definition, like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
String.prototype.nbsp = function()
{
    return this.replace(/ /g, '&amp;nbsp;')
}
</code>
</pre>
<span>Here the replace method is used with a regular expression (see Chapter 16 ) to find and replace all single spaces with the string &amp;nbsp; . If you then enter the following command:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">document.write("The quick brown fox".nbsp())</code></pre>
<span>it will output the string The&amp;nbsp;quick&amp;nbsp;brown&amp;nbsp;fox . Or here&rsquo;s a method you can add that will trim leading and trailing spaces from a string (once again using a regular expression):</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
String.prototype.trim = function()
{
    return this.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '')
}
</code>
</pre>
<span>If you issue the following statement, the output will be the string Please trim me (with the leading and trailing spaces removed):</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">document.write(" Please trim me ".trim()</code></pre>
<span>If we break down the expression into its component parts, the two / characters mark the start and end of the expression, and the final g specifies a global search. Inside the expression, the ^\s+ part searches for one or more whitespace characters appearing at the start of the search string, while the \s+$ part searches for one or more whitespace characters at the end of the search string. The | character in the middle acts to separate the alternatives.</span>
<br/>
<span>The result is that when either of these expressions matches, the match is replaced with the empty string, thus returning a trimmed version of the string without any leading or trailing whitespace.</span>
<h3>JavaScript Arrays</h3>
<span>Array handling in JavaScript is very similar to PHP, although the syntax is a little different. Nevertheless, given all you have already learned about arrays, this section should be relatively straightforward for you.</span>
<h4>Numeric Arrays</h4>
<span>To create a new array, use the following syntax:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">arrayname = new Array()</code></pre>
<span>Or you can use the shorthand form, as follows:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">arrayname = []</code></pre>
<h6>Assigning element values</h6>
<span>In PHP, you could add a new element to an array by simply assigning it without specifying the element offset, like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
$arrayname[] = "Element 1";
$arrayname[] = "Element 2";
</code>
</pre>
<span>But in JavaScript you use the push method to achieve the same thing, like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
arrayname.push("Element 1")
arrayname.push("Element 2")
</code>
</pre>
<span>This allows you to keep adding items to an array without having to keep track of the number of items. When you need to know how many elements are in an array, you can use the length property, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">document.write(arrayname.length)</code></pre>
<span>Alternatively, if you wish to keep track of the element locations yourself and place them in specific locations, you can use syntax such as this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
arrayname[0] = "Element 1"
arrayname[1] = "Element 2"
</code>
</pre>
<span>Example 15-8 shows a simple script that creates an array, loads it with some values, and then displays them.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-8. Creating, building, and printing an array</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    numbers = []
    numbers.push("One")
    numbers.push("Two")
    numbers.push("Three")

    for (j = 0 ; j &lt; numbers.length ; ++j)
        document.write("Element " + j + " = " + numbers[j] + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The output from this script is as follows:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Element 0 = One
Element 1 = Two
Element 2 = Three
</code>
</pre>
<h6>Assignment using the array keyword</h6>
<span>You can also create an array together with some initial elements by using the Array keyword, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">numbers = Array("One", "Two", "Three")</code></pre>
<span>There is nothing stopping you from adding more elements afterward as well. So now you have a couple of ways you can add items to an array, and one way of referencing them, but JavaScript offers many more, which I&rsquo;ll get to shortly. But first we&rsquo;ll look at another type of array.</span>
<h4>Associative Arrays</h4>
<span>An associative array is one in which its elements are referenced by name rather than by numeric offset. To create an associative array, define a block of elements within curly braces. For each element, place the key on the left and the contents on the right of a colon ( : ). Example 15-9 shows how you might create an associative array to hold the contents of the &ldquo;balls&rdquo; section of an online sports equipment retailer.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-9. Creating and displaying an associative array</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    balls = {
        "golf": "Golf balls, 6",
        "tennis": "Tennis balls, 3",
        "soccer": "Soccer ball, 1",
        "ping": "Ping Pong balls, 1 doz"
    }

    for (ball in balls)
        document.write(ball + " = " + balls[ball] + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>To verify that the array has been correctly created and populated, I have used another kind of for loop using the in keyword. This creates a new variable to use only within the array ( ball , in this example) and iterates through all elements of the array to the right of the in keyword ( balls , in this example). The loop acts on each element of balls , placing the key value into ball .</span>
<br/>
<span>Using this key value stored in ball , you can also get the value of the current element of balls . The result of calling up the example script in a browser is as follows:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
golf = Golf balls, 6
tennis = Tennis balls, 3
soccer = Soccer ball, 1
ping = Ping Pong balls, 1 doz
</code>
</pre>
<span>To get a specific element of an associative array, you can specify a key explicitly, in the following manner (in this case, outputting the value Soccer ball, 1 ):</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">document.write(balls['soccer'])</code></pre>
<h4>Multidimensional Arrays</h4>
<span>To create a multidimensional array in JavaScript, just place arrays inside other arrays. For example, to create an array to hold the details of a two-dimensional checkerboard (8&times;8 squares), you could use the code in Example 15-10 .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-10. Creating a multidimensional numeric array</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    checkerboard = Array(
        Array(' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o'),
        Array('o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' '),
        Array(' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o', ' ', 'o'),
        Array(' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '),
        Array(' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '),
        Array('O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' '),
        Array(' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O'),
        Array('O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' ', 'O', ' '))
    
    document.write("&lt;pre&gt;")
    
    for (j = 0 ; j &lt; 8 ; ++j)
    {
        for (k = 0 ; k &lt; 8 ; ++k)
            document.write(checkerboard[j][k] + " ")
        
        document.write("&lt;br&gt;")
    }
    
    document.write("&lt;/pre&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this example, the lowercase letters represent black pieces, and the uppercase white. A pair of nested for loops walks through the array and displays its contents.</span>
<br/>
<span>The outer loop contains two statements, so curly braces enclose them. The inner loop then processes each square in a row, outputting the character at location [j][k] , followed by a space (to square up the printout). This loop contains a single statement, so curly braces are not required to enclose it. The &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; tags ensure that the output displays correctly, like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
o o o o
o o o o
o o o o
O O O O
O O O O
O O O O
</code>
</pre>
<span>You can also directly access any element within this array by using square brackets:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">document.write(checkerboard[7][2])</code></pre>
<span>This statement outputs the uppercase letter O , the eighth element down and the third along&mdash;remember that array indexes start at 0, not 1.</span>
<h4>Using Array Methods</h4>
<span>Given the power of arrays, JavaScript comes ready-made with a number of methods for manipulating them and their data. Here is a selection of the most useful ones.</span>
<h6>concat</h6>
<span>The concat method concatenates two arrays, or a series of values within an array. For example, the following code outputs Banana,Grape,Carrot,Cabbage :</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
fruit = ["Banana", "Grape"]
veg = ["Carrot", "Cabbage"]
document.write(fruit.concat(veg))
</code>
</pre>
<span>You can specify multiple arrays as arguments, in which case concat adds all their elements in the order that the arrays are specified.</span>
<br/>
<span>Here&rsquo;s another way to use concat . This time, plain values are concatenated with the array pets , which outputs Cat,Dog,Fish,Rabbit,Hamster :</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
pets = ["Cat", "Dog", "Fish"]
more_pets = pets.concat("Rabbit", "Hamster")
document.write(more_pets)
</code>
</pre>
<h6>forEach (for non-IE browsers)</h6>
<span>The forEach method in JavaScript is another way of achieving functionality similar to the PHP foreach keyword, but only for browsers other than Internet Explorer . To use it, you pass it the name of a function, which will be called for each element within the array. Example 15-11 shows how.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-11. Using the forEach method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    pets = ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit", "Hamster"]
    pets.forEach(output)
    
    function output(element, index, array)
    {
        document.write("Element at index " + index + " has the value " +
        element + "&lt;br&gt;")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this case, the function passed to forEach is called output . It takes three parameters: the element , its index , and the array . These can be used as required by your function. In this example, just the element and index values are displayed using the function document.write .</span>
<br/>
<span>Once an array has been populated, the method is called like this:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">pets.forEach(output)</code></pre>
<span>This is the output:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Element at index 0 has the value Cat
Element at index 1 has the value Dog
Element at index 2 has the value Rabbit
Element at index 3 has the value Hamster
</code>
</pre>
<h6>forEach (a cross-browser solution)</h6>
<span>Of course, as is its way, Microsoft chose not to support the forEach method, so the previous example will work only on non&ndash;Internet Explorer browsers. Therefore, until IE does support it, and to ensure cross-browser compatibility, you should use a statement such as the following instead of pets.forEach(output) :</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">for (j = 0 ; j &lt; pets.length ; ++j) output(pets[j], j)</code></pre>
<h6>join</h6>
<span>With the join method, you can convert all the values in an array to strings and then join them together into one large string, placing an optional separator between them. Example 15-12 shows three ways of using this method.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-12. Using the join method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    pets = ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit", "Hamster"]
    document.write(pets.join() + "&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write(pets.join(' ') + "&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write(pets.join(' : ') + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Without a parameter, join uses a comma to separate the elements; otherwise, the string passed to join is inserted between each element. The output of Example 15-12 looks like this:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Cat,Dog,Rabbit,Hamster
Cat Dog Rabbit Hamster
Cat : Dog : Rabbit : Hamster
</code>
</pre>
<h6>push and pop</h6>
<span>You already saw how the push method can be used to insert a value into an array. The inverse method is pop . It deletes the most recently inserted element from an array and returns it. Example 15-13 shows an example of its use.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-13. Using the push and pop methods</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    sports = ["Football", "Tennis", "Baseball"]
    document.write("Start = " + sports + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    sports.push("Hockey")
    document.write("After Push = " + sports + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    removed = sports.pop()
    document.write("After Pop = " + sports + "&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write("Removed = " + removed + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The three main statements of this script are shown in bold type. First, the script creates an array called sports with three elements and then push es a fourth element into the array. After that, it pop s that element back off. In the process, the various current values are displayed via document.write . The script outputs the following:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Start = Football,Tennis,Baseball
After Push = Football,Tennis,Baseball,Hockey
After Pop = Football,Tennis,Baseball
Removed = Hockey
</code>
</pre>
<span>The push and pop functions are useful in situations where you need to divert from some activity to do another, and then return, as in Example 15-14 .</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-14. Using push and pop inside and outside of a loop</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    numbers = []
    for (j = 0 ; j &lt; 3 ; ++j)
    {
        numbers.push(j);
        document.write("Pushed " + j + "&lt;br&gt;")
    }
    // Perform some other activity here
    document.write("&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write("Popped " + numbers.pop() + "&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write("Popped " + numbers.pop() + "&lt;br&gt;")
    document.write("Popped " + numbers.pop() + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The output from this example is as follows:</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
Pushed 0
Pushed 1
Pushed 2
Popped 2
Popped 1
Popped 0
</code>
</pre>
<h6>Using reverse</h6>
<span>The reverse method simply reverses the order of all elements in an array. Example 15-15 shows this in action.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-15. Using the reverse method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    sports = ["Football", "Tennis", "Baseball", "Hockey"]
    sports.reverse()
    document.write(sports)
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The original array is modified, and the output from this script is as follows:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">Hockey,Baseball,Tennis,Football</code></pre>
<h6>sort</h6>
<span>With the sort method, you can place all elements of an array in alphabetical or other order, depending on the parameters used. Example 15-16 shows four types of sort.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 15-16. Using the sort method</span>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
&lt;script&gt;
    // Alphabetical sort
    sports = ["Football", "Tennis", "Baseball", "Hockey"]
    sports.sort()
    document.write(sports + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    // Reverse alphabetical sort
    sports = ["Football", "Tennis", "Baseball", "Hockey"]
    sports.sort().reverse()
    document.write(sports + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    // Ascending numeric sort
    numbers = [7, 23, 6, 74]
    numbers.sort(function(a,b){return a - b})
    document.write(numbers + "&lt;br&gt;")
    
    // Descending numeric sort
    numbers = [7, 23, 6, 74]
    numbers.sort(function(a,b){return b - a})
    document.write(numbers + "&lt;br&gt;")
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The first of the four example sections is the default sort method, &nbsp;alphabetical sort , while the second uses the default sort and then applies the reverse method to get a reverse alphabetical sort .</span>
<br/>
<span>The third and fourth sections are a little more complicated; they use a function to compare the relationships between a and b . The function doesn&rsquo;t have a name, because it&rsquo;s used only in the sort. You have already seen the function named function to create an anonymous function; we used it to define a method in a class (the show User method).</span>
<br/>
<span>Here, function creates an anonymous function meeting the needs of the sort method. If the function returns a value greater than zero, the sort assumes that b comes before a . If the function returns a value less than zero, the sort assumes that a comes before b . The sort runs this function across all the values in the array to determine their order.</span>
<br/>
<span>By manipulating the value returned ( a - b in contrast to b - a ), the third and fourth sections of Example 15-16 choose between an ascending numerical sort and a descending numerical sort .</span>
<br/>
<span>And, believe it or not, this represents the end of your introduction to JavaScript. You should now have a core knowledge of the three main technologies covered in this book. The next chapter will look at some advanced techniques used across these technologies, such as pattern matching and input validation.</span>
