<h2>Setting Up a Development Server</h2>
<span>If you wish to develop Internet applications but don&rsquo;t have your own development</span>
<span>server, you will have to upload every modification you make to a server somewhere</span>
<span>else on the Web before you can test it.</span><br/>
<span>Even on a fast broadband connection, this can still represent a significant slowdown</span>
<span>in development time. On a local computer, however, testing can be as easy as saving</span>
<span>an update (usually just a matter of clicking once on an icon) and then hitting the</span>
<span>Refresh button in your browser.</span><br/>
<span>Another advantage of a development server is that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</span>
<span>embarrassing errors or security problems while you&rsquo;re writing and testing, whereas</span>
<span>you need to be aware of what people may see or do with your application when it&rsquo;s on</span>
<span>a public website. It&rsquo;s best to iron everything out while you&rsquo;re still on a home or small</span>
<span>office system, presumably protected by firewalls and other safeguards.</span><br/>
<span>Once you have your own development server, you&rsquo;ll wonder how you ever managed</span>
<span>without one, and it&rsquo;s easy to set one up. Just follow the steps in the following sections,</span>
<span>using the appropriate instructions for a PC, a Mac, or a Linux system.</span><br/>
<span>In this chapter, we cover just the server side of the web experience, as described in</span>
<span>Chapter 1</span>
<span>. But to test the results of your work&mdash;particularly when we start using Java‐</span>
<span>Script, CSS, and HTML5 later in this book&mdash;you should also have an instance of</span>
<span>every major web browser running on some system convenient to you. Whenever pos‐</span>
<span>sible, the list of browsers should include at least Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox,</span>
<span>Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome. If you plan to ensure that your sites look good on</span>
<span>mobile devices too, you should try to arrange access to a wide range of Apple iOS and</span>
<span>Google Android phones and tablets.</span>
<h3>What Is a WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP?</h3>
<span>WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP are abbreviations for &ldquo;Windows, Apache, MySQL, and</span>
<span>PHP,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.&rdquo;</span>
<span>These abbreviations describe a fully functioning setup used for developing dynamic</span>
<span>Internet web pages.</span><br/>
<span>WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of a package that binds the bundled</span>
<span>programs together so that you don&rsquo;t have to install and set them up separately. This</span>
<span>means you can simply download and install a single program, and follow a few easy</span>
<span>prompts, to get your web development server up and running in the quickest time</span>
<span>with a minimum hassle.</span><br/>
<span>During installation, several default settings are created for you. The security configu‐</span>
<span>rations of such an installation will not be as tight as on a production web server,</span>
<span>because it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should never install such a</span>
<span>setup as a production server.</span><br/>
<span>But for developing and testing websites and applications, one of these installations</span>
<span>should be entirely sufficient.</span><br/>
<span>If you choose not to go the WAMP/MAMP/LAMP route for build‐</span>
<span>ing your own development system, you should know that down‐</span>
<span>loading and integrating the various parts yourself can be very time-</span>
<span>consuming and may require a lot of research in order to configure</span>
<span>everything</span>
<span>fully.</span>
<span>But</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>you</span>
<span>already</span>
<span>have</span>
<span>all</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>components</span>
<span>installed and integrated with one another, they should work with</span>
<span>the examples in this book.</span>
<h3>Installing XAMPP on Windows</h3>
<span>There are several available WAMP servers, each offering slightly different configura‐</span>
<span>tions, but out of the various open source and free options, the best is probably</span>
<span>XAMPP. You can download it at</span>
<span>http://apachefriends.org</span>
<span>, as shown in</span>
<span>Figure 2-1</span>
<span>.</span>
<p><img src="images/2.1.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 2-1. The XAMPP website</span><br/>
<span>I recommend that you always download the latest stable release (in this instance, it&rsquo;s</span>
<span>1.8.3), and there is a direct download link for Windows, OS X, and Linux on the main</span>
<span>page.</span><br/>
<span>During the lifetime of this edition, some of the screens and options</span>
<span>shown in the following walk-through may change. If so, just use</span>
<span>your common sense to proceed in as similar a manner as possible</span>
<span>to the sequence of actions described.</span><br/>
<span>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded the installer, run it to bring up the window shown in</span>
<span>Figure 2-2</span>
<span>. Before arriving at that window, though, if you use an anti-virus program</span>
<span>or have User Account Control activated on Windows, you may first be shown one or</span>
<span>more advisory notices, and will have to click Yes and/or OK to continue installation.</span>
<p><img src="images/2.2.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 2-2. The initial installation window of the installer</span><br/>
<span>Click Next and then uncheck any of the components shown in</span>
<span>Figure 2-3</span>
<span>that you</span>
<span>don&rsquo;t need. For example, at the minimum for this book you will want to keep Apache,</span>
<span>MySQL, PHP, and PHPMyAdmin checked. The other features are not covered in this</span>
<span>book, but you can get more details on all of these, plus the core XAMPP technologies,</span>
<span>at</span>
<span>http://apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html</span>
<span>.</span><br/>
<span>Clicking Next brings up the screen in</span>
<span>Figure 2-4</span>
<span>, in which you should choose a folder</span>
<span>for the installation. You are recommended to accept the default provided unless you</span>
<span>have a good reason to choose a different one. In this book, the default location is</span>
<span>assumed. If the folder you choose exists and is not empty, you will be unable to use it.</span>
<p><img src="images/2.3.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 2-3. Select the components to install</span><br/>
<p><img src="images/2.4.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 2-4. Choose a folder for the installation</span><br/>
<span>Clicking Next brings up the screen in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 2-5</span>
<span>&nbsp;with a checkbox already checked</span>
<span>(which you can uncheck) for supplying information on adding free installers for</span>
<span>related products in a new web browser window or tab. After you choose whether or</span>
<span>not to receive this information, click the Next button.</span>

<span>Figure 2-5. Information on related free products is available</span><br/>
<span>Having supplied the basic information required by the installer, you will arrive at the</span>
<span>screen in</span>
<span>Figure 2-6</span>
<span>. Setup is ready to start, so click the Next button.</span>

<span>Figure 2-6. Accept the default values offered for the ports</span><br/>
<span>When you click the Next button, installation will begin, and you will see the screen in</span>
<span>Figure 2-7</span>
<span>while it progresses. During installation, you can click any of the icons to</span>
<span>open up a web browser window displaying information on the product shown. The</span>
<span>whole process should take only a few minutes on most computers.</span>

<span>Figure 2-7. Installation is in progress</span><br/>
<span>Once installation is complete, the screen in</span>
<span>Figure 2-8</span>
<span>will be displayed with a check‐</span>
<span>box already checked for starting the XAMPP control panel. I recommend you leave</span>
<span>this checked and then click Finish.</span><br/>
<span>Now you are ready to start using XAMPP by configuring it from the control panel, as</span>
<span>shown in</span>
<span>Figure 2-9</span>
<span>. The panel is automatically displayed if you kept the checkbox</span>
<span>checked on completing installation. Or you can call it up from the Start menu or or</span>
<span>start screen.</span>

<span>Figure 2-8. Click Finish to complete installation</span><br/>

<span>Figure 2-9. The control panel</span><br/>
<span>The first thing I recommend you do is click the Config button at the top-right corner</span>
<span>to call up the window shown in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 2-10</span>
<span>. In particular, if they are not already</span>
<span>checked, I recommend you check the Apache and MySQL boxes to ensure they autos‐</span>
<span>tart. Or, you can simply click the Start buttons for Apache and MySQL to have them</span>
<span>run for this session only.</span>

<span>Figure 2-10. Choose your editor, autostart components and more</span><br/>
<span>While on that screen, you may find that you also wish to alter the port settings used</span>
<span>by clicking Service and Port Settings to call up the window in</span>
<span>Figure 2-11</span>
<span>.</span>

<span>Figure 2-11. Click Save to complete setup</span><br/>
<span>The default ports assigned will normally be port 80 for the Apache web server, 443 for</span>
<span>SSL, and 3306 for MySQL. If you change these values, make sure you insert these</span>
<span>changed values in place of any defaults used later in this book.</span><br/>
<span>The control panel is where you can conduct most of the actions required for manag‐</span>
<span>ing XAMPP, including editing and viewing the various configuration files, and look‐</span>
<span>ing at access, error, and other log files, all with a simple interface. For example, in</span>
<span>Figure 2-12</span>
<span>, the Apache Log button has been clicked, and the folder of log files</span>
<span>opened.</span>

<span>Figure 2-12. Opening the Apache log file folder</span><br/>
<h4>Testing the Installation</h4>
<span>The first thing to do at this point is verify that everything is working correctly. To do</span>
<span>this, you are going to try to display the default web page, which will have been saved</span>
<span>in the server&rsquo;s document root folder (see</span>
<span>Figure 2-13</span>
<span>). Enter either of the following</span>
<span>two URLs into the address bar of your browser:</span><br/>
<span>localhost</span>
<span>127.0.0.1</span>

<span>Figure 2-13. How the XAMPP home page should look by default</span><br/>
<span>The word</span>
<span>&nbsp;localhost</span>
<span>&nbsp;is used in URLs to specify the local computer, which will also</span>
<span>respond to the IP address of 127.0.0.1, so you can use either method of calling up the</span>
<span>document root of your web server.</span><br/>
<span>If you chose a server port other than 80 using the control panel (for</span>
<span>example 8080), then you must place a colon followed by that value</span>
<span>after either of the preceding URLs&mdash;like this:</span>
<span>&nbsp;localhost:8080</span>
<span>. You</span>
<span>will have to do the same for all example files in this book. So,</span>
<span>instead of entering the URL</span>
<span>localhost/example.php</span>
<span>into the address</span>
<span>bar,</span>
<span>you</span>
<span>should</span>
<span>enter</span>
<span>localhost:8080/example.php</span>
<span>(or</span>
<span>whatever</span>
<span>value you chose).</span><br/>
<h4>Accessing the document root</h4>
<span>The</span>
<span>&nbsp;document root</span>
<span>&nbsp;is the directory that contains the main web documents for a</span>
<span>domain. This is the one that is entered when a basic URL without a path is typed into</span>
<span>a browser, such as</span>
<span>http://yahoo.com</span>
<span>or, for your local server,</span>
<span>http://localhost.</span><br/>
<span>By default, XAMP uses the following location for this directory:</span><br/>
<span>C:/xampp/htdocs</span>
<span>To ensure that you have everything correctly configured, you should now create the</span>
<span>obligatory &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; file. So create a small HTML file along the following lines</span>
<span>using Windows Notepad or any other program or text editor, but not a rich word</span>
<span>processor such as Microsoft Word (unless you save as plain text):</span>
<pre><code class="html">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;A quick test&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        Hello World!
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<span>Once you have typed this, save the file into the document root directory previously</span>
<span>discussed, using the filename</span>
<span>test.htm</span>
<span>. If you are using Notepad, make sure that the</span>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
<span>Save as type&rdquo; box is changed from &ldquo;Text Documents (*.txt)&rdquo; to &ldquo;All Files (*.*)&rdquo;. Or, if</span>
<span>you prefer, you can save the file using the</span>
<span>.html</span>
<span>file extension; either is acceptable.</span><br/>
<span>You can now call this page up in your browser by entering one of the following URLs</span>
<span>(according to the extension you used) in its address bar (see</span>
<span>Figure 2-14</span>
<span>):</span><br/>
<span>http://localhost/test.htm</span><br/>
<span>http://localhost/test.html</span><br/>

<span>Figure 2-14. Your first web page</span><br/>
<h4>Alternative WAMPs</h4>
<span>When software is updated, it sometimes works differently than you&rsquo;d expected, and</span>
<span>bugs can even be introduced. So if you encounter difficulties that you cannot resolve,</span>
<span>you may prefer to choose one of the other solutions available on the Web instead.</span><br/>
<span>You will still be able to make use of all the examples in this book, but you&rsquo;ll have to</span>
<span>follow the instructions supplied with each WAMP, which may not be as easy to follow</span>
<span>as the preceding guide.</span><br/>
<span>Here&rsquo;s a selection of some of the best, in my opinion:</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>EasyPHP:</span>
<span>easyphp.org</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>WAMPServer:</span>
<span>wampserver.com/en</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Glossword WAMP:</span>

<h3>Installing XAMPP on Mac OS X</h3>
<span>XAMPP is also available on OS X, and you can download it from</span>
<span>&nbsp;http://apache</span>
<span>friends.org</span>
<span>, as shown previously in</span>
<span>Figure 2-1</span>
<span>.</span><br/>
<span>Double-click the</span>
<span>.dmg</span>
<span>file once downloaded, and then double-click the installer and</span>
<span>follow the same sequence of instructions as for Windows (although you may also be</span>
<span>given checkbox options to choose whether to load the core files, developer files, or</span>
<span>both).</span><br/>
<span>The installation process is similar to Windows, but with XAMPP being installed in</span>
<span>the following location:</span>
<span>/Applications/XAMPP</span><br/>
<span>Upon successful installation, the XAMPP Manager window will open. To ensure</span>
<span>XAMP can take proper control of web serving on your Mac, first you may need to</span>
<span>turn off any Apache web server your Mac is already running, by entering the follow‐</span>
<span>ing in a Terminal window:</span><br/>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo apachectl stop</code></pre>
<span>Now you can click the middle tab (entitled Manage Servers) at the top of the window,</span>
<span>and then click Start All to get the XAMPP servers running. After this, click the Wel‐</span>
<span>come tab to return to the main Manager screen, and then click the Go to Application</span>
<span>button, which will call up the web page shown in</span>
<span>Figure 2-13</span>
<span>. You are now all set to</span>
<span>use the software suite.</span><br/>
<span>For more information on installing and using Mac XAMPP, please refer to</span>
<span>&nbsp;apache</span>
<span>friends.org/faq_osx.html</span><br/>
<span>In the future, to call up the Manager, open your</span>
<span>Applications</span>
<span>folder</span>
<span>and then locate the</span>
<span>XAMPP</span>
<span>folder, and run</span>
<span>manager-osx</span>
<span>.</span><br/>
<h4>Accessing the Document Root</h4>
<span>On Macs, the XAMPP document root (in which web documents are stored and</span>
<span>served from) can be found at</span><br/>
<span>/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs</span><br/>
<span>To test your new installation, type some HTML such as the following into TextEdit</span>
<span>(or any editor that can save as plain text) and then save it in the document root as</span>
<span>test.html</span>
<span>. If you then type</span>
<span>localhost/test.html</span>
<span>into the address bar of your browser, the</span>
<span>result should be the same as shown previously in</span>
<span>Figure 2-14</span>
<span>:</span>
<pre>
<code class="html">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;A quick test&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        Hello World!
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<h3>Installing a LAMP on Linux</h3>
<span>This book is aimed mostly at PC and Mac users, but its contents will work equally</span>
<span>well on a Linux computer. However, there are dozens of popular flavors of Linux, and</span>
<span>each of them may require installing a LAMP in a slightly different way, so I can&rsquo;t</span>
<span>cover them all in this book.</span><br/>
<span>However, many Linux versions come preinstalled with a web server and MySQL, and</span>
<span>the chances are that you may already be all set to go. To find out, try entering the</span>
<span>following into a browser and see whether you get a default document root web page:</span><br/>
<span>http://localhost</span><br/>
<span>If this works, you probably have the Apache server installed and may well have</span>
<span>MySQL up and running too; check with your system administrator to be sure.</span><br/>
<span>If you don&rsquo;t yet have a web server installed, however, there&rsquo;s a version of XAMPP</span>
<span>available that you can download at</span>
<span>apachefriends.org</span>
<span>.</span><br/>
<span>Installation is similar to the sequence shown in the Windows section, and if you need</span>
<span>further assistance on using the suite, please refer to</span>
<span>apachefriends.org/faq_linux.html</span>
<h3>Working Remotely</h3>
<span>If you have access to a web server already configured with PHP and MySQL, you can</span>
<span>always use that for your web development. But unless you have a high-speed connec‐</span>
<span>tion, it is not always your best option. Developing locally allows you to test modifica‐</span>
<span>tions with little or no upload delay.</span><br/>
<span>Accessing MySQL remotely may not be easy either. You may have to Telnet or SSH</span>
<span>into your server to manually create databases and set permissions from the command</span>
<span>line. Your web-hosting company will advise you on how best to do this and provide</span>
<span>you with any password it has set for your MySQL access (as well as, of course, for</span>
<span>getting into the server in the first place).</span>
<h4>Logging In</h4>
<span>I recommend that, at minimum, Windows users should install a program such as</span>
<span>PuTTY, available at</span>
<span>http://putty.org</span>
<span>, for Telnet and SSH access (remember that SSH is</span>
<span>much more secure than Telnet).</span><br/>
<span>On a Mac, you already have SSH available. Just select the</span>
<span>Applications</span>
<span>folder, followed</span>
<span>by</span>
<span>&nbsp;Utilities</span>
<span>, and then launch Terminal. In the terminal window, log in to a server</span>
<span>using SSH as follows:</span><br/>
<pre><code class="bash">ssh mylogin@server.com</code></pre>
<span>where</span>
<span>server.com</span>
<span>is the name of the server you wish to log into and</span>
<span>mylogin</span>
<span>is the</span>
<span>username you will log in under. You will then be prompted for the correct password</span>
<span>for that username and, if you enter it correctly, you will be logged in.</span>
<h4>Using FTP</h4>
<span>To transfer files to and from your web server, you will need an FTP program. If you</span>
<span>go searching the Web for a good one, you&rsquo;ll find so many that it could take you quite</span>
<span>a while to come across one with all the right features for you.</span><br/>
<span>Nowadays I always recommend FireFTP, because of these advantages:</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>It is an add-on for the Firefox web browser, and will therefore work on any plat‐</span>
<span>form on which Firefox runs.</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Calling it up can be as simple as selecting a bookmark.</span><br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>It is one of the fastest and easiest-to-use FTP programs that I have encountered.</span><br/>
<span>You may say, &ldquo;But I use only Microsoft Internet Explorer, and</span>
<span>FireFTP is not available for it,&rdquo; but I would counter that if you are</span>
<span>going to develop web pages, you need a copy of each of the main</span>
<span>browsers installed on your PC anyway, as suggested at the start of</span>
<span>this chapter.</span><br/>
<span>To install FireFTP, visit</span>
<span>&nbsp;http://fireftp.mozdev.org</span>
<span>&nbsp;using Firefox and click the Down‐</span>
<span>load FireFTP link. It&rsquo;s about half a megabyte in size and installs very quickly. Once it&rsquo;s</span>
<span>installed, restart Firefox; you can then access FireFTP from the Tools menu (see</span>
<span>Figure 2-15</span>
<span>).</span><br/>
<span>Another excellent FTP program is the open source FileZilla, available from</span>
<span>&nbsp;http://</span>
<span>filezilla-project.org</span>
<span>, for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X 10.5 or newer.</span><br/>
<span>Of course, if you already have an FTP program, all the better&mdash;stick with what you</span>
<span>know.</span>

<span>Figure 2-15. FireFTP offers full FTP access from within Firefox</span><br/>
<h3>Using a Program Editor</h3>
<span>Although a plain-text editor works for editing HTML, PHP, and JavaScript, there</span>
<span>have been some tremendous improvements in dedicated program editors, which now</span>
<span>incorporate very handy features such as colored syntax highlighting. Today&rsquo;s program</span>
<span>editors are smart and can show you where you have syntax errors before you even</span>
<span>run a program. Once you&rsquo;ve used a modern editor, you&rsquo;ll wonder how you ever man‐</span>
<span>aged without one.</span><br/>
<span>There are a number of good programs available, but I have settled on Editra, because</span>
<span>it&rsquo;s free and available on Mac, Windows, and Linux/Unix. You can download a copy</span>
<span>by visiting</span>
<span>http://editra.org</span>
<span>and selecting the Download link toward the top left of the</span>
<span>page, where you can also find the documentation for it.</span>
<span>As you can see from</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 2-16</span>
<span>, Editra highlights the syntax appropriately, using</span>
<span>colors to help clarify what&rsquo;s going on. What&rsquo;s more, you can place the cursor next to</span>
<span>brackets or braces, and Editra will highlight the matching pair so that you can check</span>
<span>whether you have too many or too few. In fact, Editra does a lot more in addition,</span>
<span>which you will discover and enjoy as you use it.</span>

<span>Figure 2-16. Program editors are superior to plain-text editors</span><br/>
<span>Again, if you have a different preferred program editor, use that; it&rsquo;s always a good</span>
<span>idea to use programs you&rsquo;re already familiar with.</span>
<h3>Using an IDE</h3>
<span>As good as dedicated program editors can be for your programming productivity,</span>
<span>their utility pales into insignificance when compared to</span>
<span>integrated development envi‐</span>
<span>ronments</span>
<span>&nbsp;(IDEs), which offer many additional features such as in-editor debugging</span>
<span>and program testing, as well as function descriptions and much more.</span><br/>
<span>Figure 2-17</span>
<span>shows the popular phpDesigner IDE with a PHP program loaded into the</span>
<span>main frame, and the righthand Code Explorer listing the various classes, functions,</span>
<span>and variables that it uses.</span>

<span>Figure 2-17. When you&rsquo;re using an IDE such as phpDesigner, PHP development becomes</span><br/>
<span>much quicker and easier</span>
<span>When developing with an IDE, you can set breakpoints and then run all (or portions)</span>
<span>of your code, which will then stop at the breakpoints and provide you with informa‐</span>
<span>tion about the program&rsquo;s current state.</span><br/>
<span>As an aid to learning programming, the examples in this book can be entered into an</span>
<span>IDE and run there and then, without the need to call up your web browser. There are</span>
<span>several IDEs available for different platforms, most of which are commercial, but</span>
<span>there are some free ones too.</span>
<span>&nbsp;Table 2-1</span>
<span>&nbsp;lists some of the most popular PHP IDEs,</span>
<span>along with their download URLs.</span><br/>
<span>Choosing an IDE can be a very personal thing, so if you intend to use one, I advise</span>
<span>you to download a couple or more to try them out first; they all either have trial ver‐</span>
<span>sions or are free to use, so it won&rsquo;t cost you anything.</span><br/>
