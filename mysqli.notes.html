     Support was added for <em>MYSQL_TYPE_GEOMETRY</em> 
     to the MySQLi extension in PHP 5.3.

     Note there are different internal implementations within 
     <em>libmysqlclient</em> and <em>mysqlnd</em> for handling 
     columns of type <em>MYSQL_TYPE_GEOMETRY</em>. Generally speaking, 
     <em>mysqlnd</em> will allocate significantly less memory. For 
     example, if there is a <em>POINT</em> 
     column in a result set, <em>libmysqlclient</em> may pre-allocate up 
     to 4GB of RAM although less than 50 bytes are 
     needed for holding a <em>POINT</em> column in memory. Memory 
     allocation is much lower, less than 50 bytes, if 
     using <em>mysqlnd</em>.
