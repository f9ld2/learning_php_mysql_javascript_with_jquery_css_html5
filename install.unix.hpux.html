 <p class="para">
  This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP
  on HP-UX systems.

  There are two main options for installing PHP on HP-UX systems. Either
  compile it, or install a pre-compiled binary.

 <p class="para">
  Official pre-compiled packages are located here:

  Until this manual section is rewritten, the documentation about compiling
  PHP (and related extensions) on HP-UX systems has been removed. For now,
  consider reading the following external resource:
