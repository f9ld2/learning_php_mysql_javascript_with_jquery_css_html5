<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<span>Now that you&rsquo;ve reached the end of your journey into learning the hows, whys, and</span>
<span>wherefores of dynamic web programming, I want to leave you with a real example</span>
<span>that you can sink your teeth into. In fact, it&rsquo;s a collection of examples, because I&rsquo;ve put</span>
<span>together a simple social networking project comprising all the main features you&rsquo;d</span>
<span>expect from such a site.</span>
<span>Across the various files, there are examples of MySQL table creation and database</span>
<span>access, CSS style sheets, file inclusion, session control, DOM access, Ajax calls, event</span>
<span>and error handling, file uploading, image manipulation, the HTML5 canvas, and a</span>
<span>whole lot more.</span>
<span>Each example file is complete and self-contained, yet works with all the others to</span>
<span>build a fully working social networking site, even including a style sheet you can</span>
<span>modify to completely change the look and feel of the project. Being small and light,</span>
<span>the end product is particularly usable on mobile platforms such as a smartphone or</span>
<span>tablet, but will run equally well on a full-size desktop computer.</span>
<span>I leave it up to you to take any pieces of code you think you can use and expand on</span>
<span>them for your own purposes. Perhaps you may even wish to build on these files to</span>
<span>create a social networking site of your own.</span>
<h3>Designing a Social Networking Site</h3>
<span>Before writing any code, I sat down and came up with several things that I decided</span>
<span>were essential to such a site. These included the following:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A sign-up process</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A login form</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A logout facility</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Session control</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>User profiles with uploaded thumbnails</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A member directory</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Adding members as friends</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Public and private messaging between members</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>How to style the project</span>
<span>I decided to name the project</span>
<span>Robin&rsquo;s Nest</span>
<span>, but you have to modify only one line of</span>
<span>code (in</span>
<span>functions.php</span>
<span>) to change this to a name of your choice.</span>
<h3>On the Website</h3>
<span>All the examples in this chapter can be found on the companion website located at</span>
<span>http://lpmj.net</span>
<span>. You can also download the examples from there to your computer by</span>
<span>clicking the Download Examples link. This will download an archive file called</span>
<span>exam‐</span>
<span>ples.zip</span>
<span>, which you should extract to a suitable location on your computer.</span>
<span>Of particular interest to this chapter, within the zip file you&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s a folder</span>
<span>called</span>
<span>robinsnest</span>
<span>, in which all the following examples have been saved with the correct</span>
<span>filenames required by this sample application. So you can easily copy them all to your</span>
<span>web development folder to try them out.</span>
<h3>functions.php</h3>
<span>Let&rsquo;s jump right into the project, starting with</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 26-1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&nbsp;functions.php</span>
<span>, the</span>
<span>include file of the main functions. This file contains a little more than just the func‐</span>
<span>tions, though, because I have added the database login details here instead of using</span>
<span>yet another separate file. So the first half-dozen lines of code define the host, database</span>
<span>name, username, and password of the database to use.</span>
<span>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you call the database, as long as it already exists (see</span>
<span>Chapter 8</span>
<span>for instructions on how to create a new database). Also make sure to correctly assign</span>
<span>a MySQL username and password to</span>
<span>$dbuser</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$dbpass</span>
<span>. With correct values, the</span>
<span>subsequent two lines will open a connection to MySQL and select the database. The</span>
<span>last of the initial instructions sets the name of the social networking site by assigning</span>
<span>the value</span>
<span>Robin's Nest</span>
<span>to the variable</span>
<span>$appname</span>
<span>. If you want to change the name,</span>
<span>this is the place to do so.</span>
<h4>The Functions</h4>
<span>The project uses five main functions:</span>
<span>createTable</span>
<span>Checks whether a table already exists and, if not, creates it</span>
<span>queryMysql</span>
<span>Issues a query to MySQL, outputting an error message if it fails</span>
<span>destroySession</span>
<span>Destroys a PHP session and clears its data to log users out</span>
<span>sanitizeString</span>
<span>Removes potentially malicious code or tags from user input</span>
<span>showProfile</span>
<span>Displays a user&rsquo;s image and &ldquo;about me&rdquo; message if he has one</span>
<span>All of these should be obvious in their action to you by now, with the possible excep‐</span>
<span>tion of</span>
<span>showProfile</span>
<span>, which looks for an image of the name</span>
<span>user.jpg</span>
<span>(where</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>is the</span>
<span>username of the current user), and if it finds it, displays it. It also displays any &ldquo;about</span>
<span>me&rdquo; text the user may have saved.</span>
<span>I have ensured that error handling is in place for all the functions that need it, so that</span>
<span>they can catch any typographical or other errors you may introduce, and generate</span>
<span>error messages. However, if you use any of this code on a production server, you will</span>
<span>probably want to provide your own error-handling routines to make the code more</span>
<span>user-friendly.</span>
<span>So type</span>
<span>Example 26-1</span>
<span>and save it as</span>
<span>functions.php</span>
<span>(or download it from the compan‐</span>
<span>ion website), and you&rsquo;ll be ready to move on to the next section.</span>
<span>Example 26-1. functions.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>$dbhost = 'localhost'; // Unlikely to require changing</span>
<span>$dbname = 'robinsnest'; // Modify these...</span>
<span>$dbuser = 'robinsnest'; // ...variables according</span>
<span>$dbpass = 'rnpassword'; // ...to your installation</span>
<span>$appname = "Robin's Nest"; // ...and preference</span>
<span>$connection = new mysqli($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname);</span>
<span>if ($connection-&gt;connect_error) die($connection-&gt;connect_error);</span>
<span>function createTable($name, $query)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>queryMysql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS $name($query)");</span>
<span>echo "Table '$name' created or already exists.&lt;br&gt;";</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function queryMysql($query)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>global $connection;</span>
<span>$result = $connection-&gt;query($query);</span>
<span>if (!$result) die($connection-&gt;error);</span>
<span>return $result;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function destroySession()</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>$_SESSION=array();</span>
<span>if (session_id() != "" || isset($_COOKIE[session_name()]))</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>setcookie(session_name(), '', time()-2592000, '/');</span>
<span>session_destroy();</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function sanitizeString($var)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>global $connection;</span>
<span>$var = strip_tags($var);</span>
<span>$var = htmlentities($var);</span>
<span>$var = stripslashes($var);</span>
<span>return $connection-&gt;real_escape_string($var);</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function showProfile($user)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>if (file_exists("$user.jpg"))</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>echo "&lt;img src='$user.jpg' style='float:left;'&gt;";</span>
<span>$result = queryMysql("SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user='$user'");</span>
<span>if ($result-&gt;num_rows)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$row = $result-&gt;fetch_array(MYSQLI_ASSOC);</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>echo stripslashes($row['text']) . "&lt;br style='clear:left;'&gt;&lt;br&gt;";</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>?&gt;</span>
<span>If you read a previous edition of this book, in which these examples</span>
<span>used the old</span>
<span>mysql</span>
<span>extension, you should note that in order to ref‐</span>
<span>erence the MySQL database using</span>
<span>mysqli</span>
<span>, you must apply the</span>
<span>global</span>
<span>keyword in the</span>
<span>queryMysql</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>sanitizeString</span>
<span>functions,</span>
<span>to allow them to use the value in</span>
<span>$connection</span>
<span>.</span>
<h3>header.php</h3>
<span>For uniformity, each page of the project needs to have access to the same set of fea‐</span>
<span>tures. Therefore, I placed these things in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 26-2</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&nbsp;header.php</span>
<span>. This is the file</span>
<span>that is actually included by the other files and it includes</span>
<span>functions.php</span>
<span>. This means</span>
<span>that only a single</span>
<span>require_once</span>
<span>is needed in each file.</span>
<span>header.php</span>
<span>starts by calling the function</span>
<span>session_start</span>
<span>. As you&rsquo;ll recall from</span>
<span>Chap‐</span>
<span>ter 12</span>
<span>, this sets up a session that will remember certain values we want stored across</span>
<span>different PHP files.</span>
<span>With the session started, the program then checks whether the session variable</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>is currently assigned a value. If so, a user has logged in and the variable</span>
<span>$loggedin</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>set to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>After the main setup code in which a style sheet is loaded, a canvas element is created</span>
<span>for the logo, and a div is also created. The file</span>
<span>javascript.js</span>
<span>(see</span>
<span>Example 26-14</span>
<span>, later</span>
<span>on) is loaded to pull in the</span>
<span>O</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>S</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>C</span>
<span>functions; these would normally be in the</span>
<span>OSC.js</span>
<span>file, but to keep the number of files down I&rsquo;ve added them to the JavaScript</span>
<span>used to create the logo.</span>
<span>Using the value of</span>
<span>$loggedin</span>
<span>, an</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>block displays one of two sets of menus. The</span>
<span>non-logged-in set simply offers options of Home, Sign up, and Log in, whereas the</span>
<span>logged-in version offers full access to the project&rsquo;s features. Additionally, if a user is</span>
<span>logged in, his or her username is appended in brackets to the page title and placed</span>
<span>after the main heading. We can freely refer to</span>
<span>$user</span>
<span>wherever we want to put in the</span>
<span>name, because if the user is not logged in, that variable is empty and will have no</span>
<span>effect on the output.</span>
<span>The styling applied to this file is in the file</span>
<span>styles.css</span>
<span>(</span>
<span>Example 26-13</span>
<span>, detailed at the</span>
<span>end of this chapter) and includes creating a wide heading with a colored background,</span>
<span>and turning the links in the lists to rounded buttons.</span>
<span>Example 26-2. header.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>session_start();</span>
<span>echo "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;";</span>
<span>require_once 'functions.php';</span>
<span>$userstr = ' (Guest)';</span>
<span>if (isset($_SESSION['user']))</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>$user = $_SESSION['user'];</span>
<span>$loggedin = TRUE;</span>
<span>$userstr = " ($user)";</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>else $loggedin = FALSE;</span>
<span>echo "&lt;title&gt;$appname$userstr&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel='stylesheet' " .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"href='styles.css' type='text/css'&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;canvas id='logo' width='624' " .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"height='96'&gt;$appname&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;div class='appname'&gt;$appname$userstr&lt;/div&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;script src='javascript.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;";</span>
<span>if ($loggedin)</span>
<span>echo "&lt;br &gt;&lt;ul class='menu'&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='members.php?view=$user'&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='members.php'&gt;Members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='friends.php'&gt;Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='messages.php'&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='profile.php'&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='logout.php'&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;";</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>echo ("&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul class='menu'&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='index.php'&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='signup.php'&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='login.php'&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"&lt;span class='info'&gt;&amp;#8658; You must be logged in to " .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"view this page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;");</span>
<span>?&gt;</span>
<span>Using the</span>
<span>&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>tag, as in the preceding example, is a quick and</span>
<span>dirty way of creating spacing in page layout. In this instance it</span>
<span>works well, but generally you will probably want to use CSS mar‐</span>
<span>gins to fine-tune the spacing around elements.</span>
<h3>setup.php</h3>
<span>With the pair of included files written, it&rsquo;s now time to set up the MySQL tables they</span>
<span>will use. We do this with</span>
<span>Example 26-3</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>setup.php</span>
<span>, which you should type and load</span>
<span>into your browser before calling up any other files; otherwise, you&rsquo;ll get numerous</span>
<span>MySQL errors.</span>
<span>The tables created are short and sweet, and have the following names and columns:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>members</span>
<span>: username</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>(indexed), password</span>
<span>pass</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>messages</span>
<span>: ID</span>
<span>id</span>
<span>(indexed), author</span>
<span>auth</span>
<span>(indexed), recipient</span>
<span>recip</span>
<span>, message type</span>
<span>pm</span>
<span>, message</span>
<span>message</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>friends</span>
<span>: username</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>(indexed), friend&rsquo;s username</span>
<span>friend</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>profiles</span>
<span>: username</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>(indexed), &ldquo;about me&rdquo;</span>
<span>text</span>
<span>Because the function</span>
<span>createTable</span>
<span>first checks whether a table already exists, this</span>
<span>program can be safely called multiple times without generating any errors.</span>
<span>It is very likely that you will need to add many more columns to these tables if you</span>
<span>choose to expand on this project. If so, you may need to issue a MySQL</span>
<span>DROP TABLE</span>
<span>command before re-creating a table.</span>
<span>Example 26-3. setup.php</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;title&gt;Setting up database&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h3&gt;Setting up...&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'functions.php';</span>
<span>createTable('members',</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>'user VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>pass VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(user(6))');</span>
<span>createTable('messages',</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>'id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>auth VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>recip VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>pm CHAR(1),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>time INT UNSIGNED,</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>message VARCHAR(4096),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(auth(6)),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(recip(6))');</span>
<span>createTable('friends',</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>'user VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>friend VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(user(6)),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(friend(6))');</span>
<span>createTable('profiles',</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>'user VARCHAR(16),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>text VARCHAR(4096),</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>INDEX(user(6))');</span>
<span>?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;br&gt;...done.</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
<span>For this example to work, you must first ensure that you have</span>
<span>already created the database specified in the variable</span>
<span>$dbname</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>Example 26-1</span>
<span>, and also have granted access to it by the user given</span>
<span>the name in</span>
<span>$dbuser</span>
<span>, with the password in</span>
<span>$dbpass</span>
<span>.</span>
<h3>index.php</h3>
<span>This file is a trivial file but necessary nonetheless to give the project a home page. All</span>
<span>it does is display a simple welcome message. In a finished application, this would be</span>
<span>where you sell the virtues of your site to encourage sign-ups.</span>
<span>Incidentally, seeing as all the MySQL tables have been created and the include files</span>
<span>saved, you can now load</span>
<span>Example 26-4</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>index.php</span>
<span>, into your browser to get your first</span>
<span>peek at the new application. It should look like</span>
<span>Figure 26-1</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 26-4. index.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>echo "&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class='main'&gt;Welcome to $appname,";</span>
<span>if ($loggedin) echo " $user, you are logged in.";</span>
<span>else echo ' please sign up and/or log in to join in.';</span>
<span>?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 26-1. The main page of the site</span>
<h3>signup.php</h3>
<span>Now</span>
<span>we</span>
<span>need</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>module</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>enable</span>
<span>users</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>join</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>new</span>
<span>network,</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>that&rsquo;s</span>
<span>Example 26-5</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&nbsp;signup.php</span>
<span>. This is a slightly longer program, but you&rsquo;ve seen all its</span>
<span>parts before.</span>
<span>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the end block of HTML. This is a simple form that allows a</span>
<span>username and password to be entered. But note the use of the empty</span>
<span>span</span>
<span>given the</span>
<span>id</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>'info'</span>
<span>. This will be the destination of the Ajax call in this program that checks</span>
<span>whether a desired username is available. See</span>
<span>Chapter 18</span>
<span>for a complete description of</span>
<span>how this works.</span>
<h4>Checking for Username Availability</h4>
<span>Now go back to the program start and you&rsquo;ll see a block of JavaScript that starts with</span>
<span>the function</span>
<span>checkUser</span>
<span>. This is called by the JavaScript</span>
<span>onBlur</span>
<span>event when focus is</span>
<span>removed from the username field of the form. First it sets the contents of the span I</span>
<span>mentioned (with the</span>
<span>id</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>info</span>
<span>) to an empty string, which clears it in case it previ‐</span>
<span>ously had a value.</span>
<span>Next a request is made to the program</span>
<span>checkuser.php</span>
<span>, which reports whether the user‐</span>
<span>name</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>is available. The returned result of the Ajax call, a friendly message, is then</span>
<span>placed in the</span>
<span>info</span>
<span>span.</span>
<span>After the JavaScript section comes some PHP code that you should recognize from</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>&nbsp;Chapter 16</span>
<span>&nbsp;discussion of form validation. This section also uses the</span>
<span>sanitize</span>
<span>String</span>
<span>function to remove potentially malicious characters before looking up the</span>
<span>username in the database and, if it&rsquo;s not already taken, inserting the new username</span>
<span>$user</span>
<span>and password</span>
<span>$pass</span>
<span>.</span>
<h4>Logging In</h4>
<span>Upon successfully signing up, the user is then prompted to log in. A more fluid</span>
<span>response at this point might be to automatically log in a newly created user, but, as I</span>
<span>don&rsquo;t want to overly complicate the code, I have kept the sign-up and login modules</span>
<span>separate from each other. You can easily implement this if you want to, however.</span>
<span>This file uses the CSS class</span>
<span>fieldname</span>
<span>to arrange the form fields, aligning them neatly</span>
<span>under each other in columns. When loaded into a browser (and in conjunction with</span>
<span>checkuser.php</span>
<span>, shown later), this program will look like</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 26-2</span>
<span>, where you can</span>
<span>see that the Ajax call has identified that the username</span>
<span>Robin</span>
<span>is available. If you would</span>
<span>like the password field to show only asterisks, change its type from</span>
<span>text</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>password</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 26-5. signup.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>echo &lt;&lt;&lt;_END</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>function checkUser(user)</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>if (user.value == '')</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>

<span>Figure 26-2. The sign-up page</span>
<span>On a production server, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend storing user pass‐</span>
<span>words in the clear as I&rsquo;ve done here (for reasons of space and sim‐</span>
<span>plicity). Instead, you should salt them and store them as one-way</span>
<span>hash strings. See</span>
<span>Chapter 13</span>
<span>for more details on how to do this.</span>
<h3>checkuser.php</h3>
<span>To go with</span>
<span>signup.php</span>
<span>, here&rsquo;s</span>
<span>Example 26-6</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>checkuser.php</span>
<span>, which looks up a username</span>
<span>in the database and returns a string indicating whether it has already been taken.</span>
<span>Because it relies on the functions</span>
<span>sanitizeString</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>queryMysql</span>
<span>, the program first</span>
<span>includes the file</span>
<span>functions.php</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Then, if the</span>
<span>$_POST</span>
<span>variable</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>has a value, the function looks it up in the database</span>
<span>and, depending on whether it exists as a username, outputs either &ldquo;Sorry, this user‐</span>
<span>name</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>taken&rdquo;</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>&ldquo;</span>
<span>This</span>
<span>username</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>available.&rdquo;</span>
<span>Just</span>
<span>checking</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>function</span>
<span>mysql_num_rows</span>
<span>against the result is sufficient for this, as it will return</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>for not</span>
<span>found, or</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>if it is found.</span>
<span>The HTML entities</span>
<span>&amp;#x2718;</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>&amp;#x2714;</span>
<span>are also used to preface the string with</span>
<span>either a cross or a checkmark.</span>
<span>Example 26-6. checkuser.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'functions.php';</span>
<span>if (isset($_POST['user']))</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>$user = sanitizeString($_POST['user']);</span>
<span>$result = queryMysql("SELECT * FROM members WHERE user='$user'");</span>
<span>if ($result-&gt;num_rows)</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>echo "&lt;span class='taken'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x2718; " .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"This username is taken&lt;/span&gt;";</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>echo "&lt;span class='available'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#x2714; " .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"This username is available&lt;/span&gt;";</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>?&gt;</span>
<h3>login.php</h3>
<span>With users now able to sign up to the site,</span>
<span>Example 26-7</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>login.php</span>
<span>, provides the code</span>
<span>needed to let them log in. Like the sign-up page, it features a simple HTML form and</span>
<span>some basic error checking, as well as using</span>
<span>sanitizeString</span>
<span>before querying the</span>
<span>MySQL database.</span>
<span>The main thing to note here is that, upon successful verification of the username and</span>
<span>password, the session variables</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>pass</span>
<span>are given the username and password</span>
<span>values. As long as the current session remains active, these variables will be accessible</span>
<span>by all the programs in the project, allowing them to automatically provide access to</span>
<span>logged-in users.</span>
<span>You may be interested in the use of the</span>
<span>die</span>
<span>function upon successfully logging in.</span>
<span>This is there because it combines an</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>and an</span>
<span>exit</span>
<span>command in one, thus saving a</span>
<span>line of code. For styling, this (and most of the files) applies the class</span>
<span>main</span>
<span>to indent</span>
<span>the content from the left-hand edge.</span>
<span>When you call this program up in your browser, it should look like</span>
<span>Figure 26-3</span>
<span>. Note</span>
<span>how the input type of</span>
<span>password</span>
<span>has been used here to mask the password with aster‐</span>
<span>isks to prevent it from being viewed by anyone looking over the user&rsquo;s shoulder.</span>
<span>Example 26-7. login.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>echo "&lt;div class='main'&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Please enter your details to log in&lt;/h3&gt;";</span>
<span>$error = $user = $pass = "";</span>
<span>if (isset($_POST['user']))</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>$user = sanitizeString($_POST['user']);</span>
<span>$pass = sanitizeString($_POST['pass']);</span>
<span>if ($user == "" || $pass == "")</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$error = "Not all fields were entered&lt;br&gt;";</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$result = queryMySQL("SELECT user,pass FROM members</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>WHERE user='$user' AND pass='$pass'");</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>if ($result-&gt;num_rows == 0)</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$error = "&lt;span class='error'&gt;Username/Password</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>invalid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;";</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$_SESSION['user'] = $user;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>$_SESSION['pass'] = $pass;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>die("You are now logged in. Please &lt;a href='members.php?view=$user'&gt;" .</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>"click here&lt;/a&gt; to continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;");</span>

<span>Figure 26-3. The login page</span>
<h3>profile.php</h3>
<span>One of the first things that new users may want to do after signing up and logging</span>
<span>in is to create a profile, which can be done via</span>
<span>Example 26-8</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>profile.php</span>
<span>. I think you&rsquo;ll</span>
<span>find some interesting code here, such as routines to upload, resize, and sharpen</span>
<span>images.</span>
<span>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the main HTML at the end of the code. This is like the forms</span>
<span>you&rsquo;ve just seen, but this time it has the parameter</span>
<span>enctype='multipart/form-data'</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>This allows us to send more than one type of data at a time, enabling the posting of</span>
<span>an image as well as some text. There&rsquo;s also an input type of</span>
<span>file</span>
<span>, which creates a</span>
<span>Browse button that a user can press to select a file to be uploaded.</span>
<span>When the form is submitted, the code at the start of the program is executed. The</span>
<span>first thing it does is ensure that a user is logged in before allowing program execution</span>
<span>to proceed. Only then is the page heading displayed.</span>
<h4>Adding the &ldquo;About Me&rdquo; Text</h4>
<span>Then the Post variable</span>
<span>text</span>
<span>is checked to see whether some text was posted to the</span>
<span>program. If so, it is sanitized and all long whitespace sequences (including returns</span>
<span>and line feeds) are replaced with a single space. This function incorporates a double</span>
<span>security check, ensuring that the user actually exists in the database and that no</span>
<span>attempted hacking can succeed before inserting this text into the database, where it</span>
<span>will become the user&rsquo;s &ldquo;about me&rdquo; details.</span>
<span>If no text was posted, the database is queried to see whether any text already exists in</span>
<span>order to prepopulate the</span>
<span>textarea</span>
<span>for the user to edit it.</span>
<h4>Adding a</h4>
<h4>Profile Image</h4>
<span>Next we move on to the section where the</span>
<span>$_FILES</span>
<span>system variable is checked to see</span>
<span>whether an image has been uploaded. If so, a string variable called</span>
<span>$saveto</span>
<span>is created,</span>
<span>based on the user&rsquo;s username followed by the extension</span>
<span>.jpg</span>
<span>. For example, user Jill will</span>
<span>cause</span>
<span>$saveto</span>
<span>to have the value</span>
<span>Jill.jpg</span>
<span>. This is the file where the uploaded image will</span>
<span>be saved for use in the user&rsquo;s profile.</span>
<span>Following this, the uploaded image type is examined and is accepted only if it is a</span>
<span>jpeg</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>png</span>
<span>, or</span>
<span>gif</span>
<span>image. Upon success, the variable</span>
<span>$src</span>
<span>is populated with the uploaded</span>
<span>image using one of the</span>
<span>imagecreatefrom</span>
<span>functions according to the image type</span>
<span>uploaded. The image is now in a raw format that PHP can process. If the image is not</span>
<span>of an allowed type, the flag</span>
<span>$typeok</span>
<span>is set to</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, preventing the final section of</span>
<span>image upload code from being processed.</span>
<h4>Processing the Image</h4>
<span>First, we store the image&rsquo;s dimensions in</span>
<span>$w</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$h</span>
<span>using the following statement,</span>
<span>which is a quick way of assigning values from an array to separate variables:</span>
<span>list($w, $h) = getimagesize($saveto);</span>
<span>Then, using the value of</span>
<span>$max</span>
<span>(which is set to</span>
<span>100</span>
<span>), we calculate new dimensions that</span>
<span>will result in a new image of the same ratio, but with no dimension greater than 100</span>
<span>pixels. This results in giving the variables</span>
<span>$tw</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$th</span>
<span>the new values needed. If you</span>
<span>want smaller or larger thumbnails, simply change the value of</span>
<span>$max</span>
<span>accordingly.</span>
<span>Next, the function</span>
<span>imagecreatetruecolor</span>
<span>is called to create a new, blank canvas</span>
<span>$tw</span>
<span>wide and</span>
<span>$th</span>
<span>high in</span>
<span>$tmp</span>
<span>. Then</span>
<span>imagecopyresampled</span>
<span>is called to resample the image</span>
<span>from</span>
<span>$src</span>
<span>, to the new</span>
<span>$tmp</span>
<span>. Sometimes resampling images can result in a slightly</span>
<span>blurred copy, so the next piece of code uses the</span>
<span>imageconvolution</span>
<span>function to</span>
<span>sharpen the image up a bit.</span>
<span>Finally, the image is saved as a</span>
<span>&nbsp;jpeg</span>
<span>&nbsp;file in the location defined by the variable</span>
<span>$saveto</span>
<span>, after which we remove both the original and the resized image canvases</span>
<span>from memory using the</span>
<span>imagedestroy</span>
<span>function, returning the memory that was</span>
<span>used.</span>
<h4>Displaying the Current</h4>
<h4>Profile</h4>
<span>Last but not least, so that the user can see what the current profile looks like before</span>
<span>editing it, the</span>
<span>showProfile</span>
<span>function from</span>
<span>functions.php</span>
<span>is called prior to outputting</span>
<span>the form HTML. If no profile exists yet, nothing will be displayed.</span>
<span>When a profile image is displayed, CSS is applied to it to provide a border, shadow,</span>
<span>and a margin to its right&mdash;to separate the profile text from the image. The result of</span>
<span>loading</span>
<span>Example 26-8</span>
<span>into a browser is shown in</span>
<span>Figure 26-4</span>
<span>, where you can see that</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>textarea</span>
<span>has been prepopulated with the &ldquo;about me&rdquo; text.</span>
<span>Example 26-8.</span>
<span>profile.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>if (!$loggedin) die();</span>

<span>Figure 26-4. Editing a user profile</span>
<h3>members.php</h3>
<span>Using</span>
<span>Example 26-9</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>members.php</span>
<span>, your users will be able to find other members</span>
<span>and choose to add them as friends (or drop them if they are already friends). This</span>
<span>program has two modes. The first lists all members and their relationships to you,</span>
<span>and the second shows a user&rsquo;s profile.</span>
<h4>Viewing a User&rsquo;s</h4>
<h4>Profile</h4>
<span>The code for the latter mode comes first, where a test is made for the Get variable</span>
<span>view</span>
<span>. If it exists, a user wants to view someone&rsquo;s profile, so the program does that</span>
<span>using the</span>
<span>showProfile</span>
<span>function, along with providing a couple of links to the user&rsquo;s</span>
<span>friends and messages.</span>
<h4>Adding and Dropping Friends</h4>
<span>After that, the two Get variables,</span>
<span>add</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>remove</span>
<span>, are tested. If one or the other has a</span>
<span>value, it will be the username of a user to either add or drop as a friend. We achieve</span>
<span>this by looking up the user in the MySQL</span>
<span>friends</span>
<span>table and either inserting a friend</span>
<span>username or removing it from the table.</span>
<span>And, of course, every posted variable is first passed through</span>
<span>sanitizeString</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>ensure that it is safe to use with MySQL.</span>
<h4>Listing All Members</h4>
<span>The final section of code issues a SQL query to list all usernames. The code places the</span>
<span>number returned in the variable</span>
<span>$num</span>
<span>before outputting the page heading.</span>
<span>A</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop then iterates through each and every member, fetching their details and</span>
<span>then looking them up in the</span>
<span>friends</span>
<span>table to see if they are either being followed by</span>
<span>or a follower of the user. If someone is both a follower and a followee, she is classed as</span>
<span>a mutual friend.</span>
<span>The variable</span>
<span>$t1</span>
<span>is nonzero when the user is following another member, and</span>
<span>$t2</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>nonzero when another member is following the user. Depending on these values, text</span>
<span>is displayed after each username, showing the relationship (if any) to the current user.</span>
<span>Icons are also displayed to show the relationships. A double pointing arrow means</span>
<span>that the users are mutual friends. A left-pointing arrow indicates the user is following</span>
<span>another member. And a right-pointing arrow indicates that another member is fol‐</span>
<span>lowing the user.</span>
<span>Finally, depending on whether the user is following another member, a link is pro‐</span>
<span>vided to either add or drop that member as a friend.</span>
<span>When you call</span>
<span>Example 26-9</span>
<span>up in a browser, it will look like</span>
<span>Figure 26-5</span>
<span>. See how</span>
<span>the user is invited to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; a nonfollowing member, but if the member is already</span>
<span>following the user, a &ldquo;recip&rdquo; link to reciprocate the friendship is offered. In the case of</span>
<span>a user already following another member, the user can select &ldquo;drop&rdquo; to end the follow‐</span>
<span>ing.</span>

<span>Figure 26-5. Using the members module</span>
<span>On a production server, there could be thousands or even hun‐</span>
<span>dreds of thousands of users, so you would probably substantially</span>
<span>modify this program to include searching the &ldquo;about me&rdquo; text, sup‐</span>
<span>port paging of the output a screen at a time, and so on.</span>
<h3>friends.php</h3>
<span>The module that shows a user&rsquo;s friends and followers is</span>
<span>Example 26-10</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>friends.php</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>This interrogates the</span>
<span>friends</span>
<span>table just like the</span>
<span>members.php</span>
<span>program, but only for a</span>
<span>single user. It then shows all of that user&rsquo;s mutual friends and followers along with the</span>
<span>people he is following.</span>
<span>All the followers are saved into an array called</span>
<span>$followers</span>
<span>, and all the people being</span>
<span>followed are placed in an array called</span>
<span>$following</span>
<span>. Then a neat piece of code is used</span>
<span>to extract all those who are both following and followed by the user, like this:</span>
<span>$mutual = array_intersect($followers, $following);</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>array_intersect</span>
<span>function extracts all members common to both arrays and</span>
<span>returns a new array containing only those people. This array is then stored in</span>
<span>$mutual</span>
<span>. Now it&rsquo;s possible to use the</span>
<span>array_diff</span>
<span>function for each of the</span>
<span>$followers</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$following</span>
<span>arrays to keep only those people who are</span>
<span>&nbsp;not</span>
<span>&nbsp;mutual friends, like</span>
<span>this:</span>
<span>$followers = array_diff($followers, $mutual);</span>
<span>$following = array_diff($following, $mutual);</span>
<span>This results in the array</span>
<span>$mutual</span>
<span>containing only mutual friends,</span>
<span>$followers</span>
<span>con‐</span>
<span>taining only followers (and no mutual friends), and</span>
<span>$following</span>
<span>containing only peo‐</span>
<span>ple being followed (and no mutual friends).</span>
<span>Now that we&rsquo;re armed with these arrays, it&rsquo;s a simple matter to separately display each</span>
<span>category of members, as can be seen in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 26-6</span>
<span>. The PHP</span>
<span>sizeof</span>
<span>function</span>
<span>returns the number of elements in an array; here I use it just to trigger code when the</span>
<span>size is nonzero (that is, friends of that type exist). Note how, by using the variables</span>
<span>$name1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>$name2</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>$name3</span>
<span>in the relevant places, the code can tell when you&rsquo;re look‐</span>
<span>ing at your own friends list, using the words</span>
<span>Your</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>You are</span>
<span>, instead of simply dis‐</span>
<span>playing the username. The commented line can be uncommented if you wish to</span>
<span>display the user&rsquo;s profile information on this screen.</span>
<span>Example 26-10. friends.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>if (!$loggedin) die();</span>
<span>if (isset($_GET['view'])) $view = sanitizeString($_GET['view']);</span>

<h3>messages.php</h3>
<span>The last of the main modules is</span>
<span>Example 26-11</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>messages.php</span>
<span>. The program starts by</span>
<span>checking whether a message has been posted in variable</span>
<span>text</span>
<span>. If so, it is inserted into</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>messages</span>
<span>table. At the same time, the value of</span>
<span>pm</span>
<span>is also stored. This indicates</span>
<span>whether a message is private or public. A</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>represents a public message, and</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>is pri‐</span>
<span>vate.</span>
<span>Next, the user&rsquo;s profile and a form for entering a message are displayed, along with</span>
<span>radio buttons to choose between a private or public message. After this, all the mes‐</span>
<span>sages are shown, depending on whether they are private or public. If they are public,</span>
<span>all users can see them, but private messages are visible only to the sender and recipi‐</span>
<span>ent. This is all handled by a couple of queries to the MySQL database. Additionally,</span>
<span>when a message is private, it is introduced by the word</span>
<span>whispered</span>
<span>and shown in italic.</span>
<span>Finally, the program displays a couple of links to refresh the messages (in case</span>
<span>another user has posted one in the meantime) and to view the user&rsquo;s friends. The trick</span>
<span>using the variables</span>
<span>$name1</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$name2</span>
<span>is again used so that when you view your own</span>
<span>profile, the word</span>
<span>Your</span>
<span>is displayed instead of the username.</span>
<span>You can see the result of viewing this program with a browser in</span>
<span>Figure 26-7</span>
<span>. Note</span>
<span>how users viewing their own messages are provided with links to erase any they don&rsquo;t</span>
<span>want.</span>

<h3>logout.php</h3>
<span>The final ingredient in our social networking recipe is</span>
<span>Example 26-12</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>logout.php</span>
<span>, the</span>
<span>logout page that closes a session and deletes any associated data and cookies. The</span>
<span>result of calling up this program is shown in</span>
<span>Figure 26-8</span>
<span>, where the user is now asked</span>
<span>to click a link that will take her to the un-logged-in home page and remove the</span>
<span>logged-in links from the top of the screen. Of course, you could write a JavaScript or</span>
<span>PHP redirect to do this (probably a good idea if you wish to keep logout looking</span>
<span>clean).</span>
<span>Example 26-12. logout.php</span>
<span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>require_once 'header.php';</span>
<span>if (isset($_SESSION['user']))</span>

<h3>styles.css</h3>
<span>The style sheet used for this project is shown in</span>
<span>Example 26-13</span>
<span>. There are a number</span>
<span>of sets of declarations, as follows:</span>
<span>*</span>
<span>Sets the default font family and size for the project using the universal selector.</span>
<span>body</span>
<span>Sets the width of the project window, centers it horizontally, specifies a background</span>
<span>color, and gives it a border.</span>
<span>html</span>
<span>Sets the background color of the HTML section.</span>
<span>img</span>
<span>Gives all images a border, shadow, and a righthand margin.</span>
<span>li a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>.button</span>
<span>Remove underlines from hyperlinks in all</span>
<span>&lt;a&gt;</span>
<span>tags that are within a</span>
<span>&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span>element,</span>
<span>and all elements employing the</span>
<span>button</span>
<span>class.</span>
<span>li a:hover</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>.button:hover</span>
<span>Sets the color in which</span>
<span>&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span>elements and the</span>
<span>button</span>
<span>class should display text when</span>
<span>hovered over.</span>
<span>.appname</span>
<span>Sets the properties for the heading (which uses the</span>
<span>appname</span>
<span>class), including center‐</span>
<span>ing, background and text colors, the font family and size, and the padding.</span>
<span>.fieldname</span>
<span>Sets the width of elements using the</span>
<span>fieldname</span>
<span>class by first floating them.</span>
<span>.main</span>
<span>This class applies an indent to elements that use it.</span>
<span>.info</span>
<span>This class is used for displaying important information. It sets a background and</span>
<span>foreground text color, applies a border and padding, and indents elements that</span>
<span>employ it.</span>
<span>.menu li</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>.button</span>
<span>These declarations ensure that all</span>
<span>&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span>elements and the</span>
<span>button</span>
<span>class display inline,</span>
<span>have padding applied, and include a border, a background and foreground text color,</span>
<span>a right margin, rounded borders, and a shadow&mdash;resulting in a button effect.</span>
<span>.subhead</span>
<span>Emphasizes sections of text.</span>
<span>.taken</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>.available</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>.error</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>.whisper</span>
<span>These declarations set the colors and font styles to be used for displaying different</span>
<span>types of information.</span>
<span>#logo</span>
<span>These rules style the logo text as a fallback in case a non-HTML5 browser is in use</span>
<span>and the canvas logo doesn&rsquo;t get created.</span>

<span>Finally, there&rsquo;s the JavaScript file (see</span>

<span>, and</span>
<span>C</span>
<span>functions used throughout this book, along with some code to draw the logo for the</span>

<span>been of help and thank you for reading this book.</span>
<span>But before you go and try out your newly learned skills on the Web at large, please</span>

<span>there you should find useful.</span>
<h2>Solutions to the Chapter Questions</h2>
<span>Chapter 1</span>
<h3>Answers</h3>
<span>1.</span>
<span>A web server (such as Apache), a server-side scripting language (PHP), a database</span>
<span>(MySQL), and a client-side scripting language (JavaScript).</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>HyperText Markup Language: the web page itself, including text and markup tags.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>Like nearly all database engines, MySQL accepts commands in Structured Query</span>
<span>Language (SQL). SQL is the way that every user (including a PHP program) com‐</span>
<span>municates with MySQL.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>PHP runs on the server, whereas JavaScript runs on the client. PHP can communi‐</span>
<span>cate with the database to store and retrieve data, but it can&rsquo;t alter the user&rsquo;s web</span>
<span>page quickly and dynamically. JavaScript has the opposite benefits and drawbacks.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>Cascading Style Sheets: styling and layout rules applied to the elements in an</span>
<span>HTML document.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>Probably the most interesting new elements in HTML5 are</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&lt;video&gt;</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>&lt;canvas&gt;</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>although</span>
<span>there</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>many</span>
<span>others</span>
<span>such</span>
<span>as</span>
<span>&lt;article&gt;</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>
<span>, and more.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>Some of these technologies are controlled by companies that accept bug reports</span>
<span>and fix the errors like any software company. But open source software also</span>
<span>depends on a community, so your bug report may be handled by any user who</span>
<span>understands the code well enough. You may someday fix bugs in an open source</span>
<span>tool yourself.</span>

<span>WAMP stands for</span>
<span>&nbsp;Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>&nbsp;M</span>
<span>&nbsp;in MAMP stands for</span>
<span>Mac</span>
<span>instead of Windows; and the</span>
<span>L</span>
<span>in LAMP stands for</span>
<span>Linux</span>
<span>. They all refer to a</span>
<span>complete solution for hosting dynamic web pages.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>Both 127.0.0.1 and</span>
<span>&nbsp;http://localhost</span>
<span>&nbsp;are ways of referring to the local computer.</span>
<span>When a WAMP or MAMP is properly configured, you can type either into a</span>
<span>browser&rsquo;s address bar to call up the default page on the local server.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>FTP stands for</span>
<span>File Transfer Protocol.</span>
<span>An FTP program is used to transfer files back</span>
<span>and forth between a client and a server.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>It is necessary to FTP files to a remote server in order to update it, which can sub‐</span>
<span>stantially increase development time if this action is carried out many times in a</span>
<span>session.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>Dedicated program editors are smart and can highlight problems in your code</span>
<span>before you even run it.</span>
<span>Chapter 3</span>
<h3>Answers</h3>
<span>1.</span>
<span>The tag used to start PHP interpreting code is</span>
<span>&lt;?php...?&gt;</span>
<span>, which can be shortened</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>&lt;?...?&gt;</span>
<span>but is not recommended practice.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>You can use</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>for a single-line comment or /</span>
<span>*...*/</span>
<span>to span multiple lines.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>All PHP statements must end with a semicolon (</span>
<span>;</span>
<span>).</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>With the exception of constants, all PHP variables must begin with</span>
<span>$</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>Variables hold a value that can be a string, a number, or other data.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>$variable = 1</span>
<span>is an assignment statement, whereas</span>
<span>$variable == 1</span>
<span>is a compari‐</span>
<span>son operator. Use</span>
<span>$variable = 1</span>
<span>to set the value of</span>
<span>$variable</span>
<span>. Use</span>
<span>$variable ==</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>to find out later in the program whether</span>
<span>$variable</span>
<span>equals</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>. If you mistakenly</span>
<span>use</span>
<span>$variable = 1</span>
<span>where you meant to do a comparison, it will do two things you</span>
<span>probably don&rsquo;t want: set</span>
<span>$variable</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>and return a</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>value all the time, no</span>
<span>matter what its previous value was.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>A hyphen is reserved for the subtraction operators. A construct like</span>
<span>$current-</span>
<span>user</span>
<span>would be harder to interpret if hyphens were also allowed in variable names</span>
<span>and, in any case, would lead programs to be ambiguous.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>Variable names are case-sensitive.</span>
<span>$This_Variable</span>
<span>is not the same as</span>
<span>$this_vari</span>
<span>able</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>You cannot use spaces in variable names, as this would confuse the PHP parser.</span>
<span>Instead, try using the</span>
<span>_</span>
<span>(underscore).</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>To convert one variable type to another, reference it and PHP will automatically</span>
<span>convert it for you.</span>
<span>11.</span>
<span>There is no difference between</span>
<span>++$j</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$j++</span>
<span>unless the value of</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>is being tested,</span>
<span>assigned to another variable, or passed as a parameter to a function. In such cases,</span>
<span>++$j</span>
<span>increments</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>before the test or other operation is performed, whereas</span>
<span>$j++</span>
<span>performs the operation and then increments</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>12.</span>
<span>Generally, the operators</span>
<span>&amp;&amp;</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>are interchangeable except where precedence</span>
<span>is important, in which case</span>
<span>&amp;&amp;</span>
<span>has a high precedence, while</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>has a low one.</span>
<span>13.</span>
<span>You can use multiple lines within quotations marks or the</span>
<span>&lt;&lt;&lt;_END..._END;</span>
<span>con‐</span>
<span>struct to create a multiline</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>or assignment. The closing tag must begin at the</span>
<span>start of a line, and end with a semicolon followed by a new line.</span>
<span>14.</span>
<span>You cannot redefine constants because, by definition, once defined they retain</span>
<span>their value until the program terminates.</span>
<span>15.</span>
<span>You can use</span>
<span>\'</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>\"</span>
<span>to escape either a single or double quote.</span>
<span>16.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>print</span>
<span>commands are similar in that they are both constructs, except</span>
<span>that</span>
<span>print</span>
<span>behaves like a PHP function and takes a single argument, while</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>can take multiple arguments.</span>
<span>17.</span>
<span>The purpose of functions is to separate discrete sections of code into their own,</span>
<span>self-contained sections that can be referenced by a single function name.</span>
<span>18.</span>
<span>You can make a variable accessible to all parts of a PHP program by declaring it as</span>
<span>global</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>19.</span>
<span>If you generate data within a function, you can convey the data to the rest of the</span>
<span>program by returning a value or modifying a global variable.</span>
<span>20.</span>
<span>When you combine a string with a number, the result is another string.</span>
<span>Chapter 4</span>
<h3>Answers</h3>
<span>1.</span>
<span>In PHP,</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>represents the value</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>represents</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, which can be</span>
<span>thought of as &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; and is output as the empty string.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>The simplest forms of expressions are literals (such as numbers and strings) and</span>
<span>variables, which simply evaluate to themselves.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>The difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators is the number of</span>
<span>operands each requires (one, two, and three, respectively).</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>The best way to force your own operator precedence is to place parentheses</span>
<span>around subexpressions to which you wish to give high precedence.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>Operator associativity</span>
<span>refers to the direction of processing (left to right, or right to</span>
<span>left).</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>You use the identity operator when you wish to bypass PHP&rsquo;s automatic operand</span>
<span>type changing (also called</span>
<span>type casting</span>
<span>).</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>The three conditional statement types are</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>, and the</span>
<span>?:</span>
<span>operator.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>To skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one, use a</span>
<span>continue</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>Loops using</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statements are more powerful than</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loops, because they sup‐</span>
<span>port two additional parameters to control the loop handling.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>Most conditional expressions in</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>statements are literal (or Boolean)</span>
<span>and therefore trigger execution when they evaluate to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. Numeric expressions</span>
<span>trigger execution when they evaluate to a nonzero value. String expressions trigger</span>
<span>execution when they evaluate to a nonempty string. A</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>value is evaluated as</span>
<span>false and therefore does not trigger execution.</span>

<h3>Answers</h3>
<span>1.</span>
<span>Using functions avoids the need to copy or rewrite similar code sections many</span>
<span>times over by combining sets of statements so that they can be called by a simple</span>
<span>name.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>By default, a function can return a single value. But by utilizing arrays, references,</span>
<span>and global variables, any number of values can be returned.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>When you reference a variable by name, such as by assigning its value to another</span>
<span>variable or by passing its value to a function, its value is copied. The original does</span>
<span>not change when the copy is changed. But if you reference a variable, only a</span>
<span>pointer (or reference) to its value is used, so that a single value is referenced by</span>
<span>more than one name. Changing the value of the reference will change the original</span>
<span>as well.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>Scope</span>
<span>refers to which parts of a program can access a variable. For example, a vari‐</span>
<span>able of global scope can be accessed by all parts of a PHP program.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>To incorporate one file within another, you can use the</span>
<span>include</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>require</span>
<span>direc‐</span>
<span>tives, or their safer variants,</span>
<span>include_once</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>require_once</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>A function is a set of statements referenced by a name that can receive and return</span>
<span>values. An object may contain zero or many functions (which are then called</span>
<span>methods) as well as variables (which are called properties), all combined in a single</span>
<span>unit.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>To create a new object in PHP, use the</span>
<span>new</span>
<span>keyword like this:</span>
<span>$object = new Class;</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>To create a subclass, use the</span>
<span>extends</span>
<span>keyword with syntax such as this:</span>
<span>class Subclass extends Parentclass ...</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>To call a piece of initializing code when an object is created, create a constructor</span>
<span>method called</span>
<span>__construct</span>
<span>within the class and place your code there.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>Explicitly declaring properties within a class is unnecessary, as they will be implic‐</span>
<span>itly declared upon first use. But it is considered good practice as it helps with code</span>
<span>readability and debugging, and is especially useful to other people who may have</span>
<span>to maintain your code.</span>

<h3>Answers</h3>
<span>1.</span>
<span>A numeric array can be indexed numerically using numbers or numeric variables.</span>
<span>An associative array uses alphanumeric identifiers to index elements.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>The main benefit of the</span>
<span>array</span>
<span>keyword is that it enables you to assign several val‐</span>
<span>ues at a time to an array without repeating the array name.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>Both the</span>
<span>each</span>
<span>function and the</span>
<span>foreach...as</span>
<span>loop construct return elements from</span>
<span>an array; both start at the beginning and increment a pointer to make sure the next</span>
<span>element is returned each time; and both return</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>when the end of the array is</span>
<span>reached. The difference is that the</span>
<span>each</span>
<span>function returns just a single element, so it</span>
<span>is usually wrapped in a loop. The</span>
<span>foreach...as</span>
<span>construct is already a loop, execut‐</span>
<span>ing repeatedly until the array is exhausted or you explicitly break out of the loop.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To create a multidimensional array, you need to assign additional arrays to ele‐</span>
<span>ments of the main array.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>You can use the</span>
<span>count</span>
<span>function to count the number of elements in an array.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>The purpose of the</span>
<span>explode</span>
<span>function is to extract sections from a string that are</span>
<span>separated by an identifier, such as extracting words separated by spaces within a</span>
<span>sentence.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>To reset PHP&rsquo;s internal pointer into an array back to the first element, call the</span>
<span>reset</span>
<span>function.</span>

<span>To take the input string</span>
<span>"Happy Birthday"</span>
<span>and output the string</span>
<span>"**Happy"</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>you could use a</span>
<span>printf</span>
<span>statement such as this:</span>
<span>printf("%'*7.5s", "Happy Birthday");</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>To send the output from</span>
<span>printf</span>
<span>to a variable instead of to a browser, you would</span>
<span>use</span>
<span>sprintf</span>
<span>instead.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To create a Unix timestamp for 7:11 a.m. on May 2nd, 2016, you could use the</span>
<span>following command:</span>
<span>$timestamp = mktime(7, 11, 0, 5, 2, 2016);</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>You would use the</span>
<span>w+</span>
<span>file access mode with</span>
<span>fopen</span>
<span>to open a file in write and read</span>
<span>mode, with the file truncated and the file pointer at the start.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>The PHP command for deleting the file</span>
<span>file.txt</span>
<span>is as follows:</span>
<span>unlink('file.txt');</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>The PHP function</span>
<span>file_get_contents</span>
<span>is used to read in an entire file in one go. It</span>
<span>will also read them from across the Internet if provided with a URL.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>The PHP superglobal associative array</span>
<span>$_FILES</span>
<span>contains the details about uploa‐</span>
<span>ded files.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>The PHP</span>

<span>The semicolon is used by MySQL to separate or end commands. If you forget to</span>
<span>enter it, MySQL will issue a prompt and wait for you to enter it. (In the answers in</span>
<span>this section, I&rsquo;ve left off the semicolon, because it looks strange in the text. But it</span>
<span>must terminate every statement.)</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>To see the available databases, type</span>
<span>SHOW databases</span>
<span>. To see tables within a data‐</span>
<span>base that you are using, type</span>
<span>SHOW tables</span>
<span>. (These commands are case-insensitive.)</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>To create this new user, use the</span>
<span>GRANT</span>
<span>command like this:</span>
<span>GRANT PRIVILEGES ON newdatabase.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost'</span>
<span>IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To view the structure of a table, type</span>
<span>DESCRIBE tablename</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>The purpose of a MySQL index is to substantially decrease database access times</span>
<span>by maintaining indexes of one or more key columns, which can then be quickly</span>
<span>searched to locate rows within a table.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>A</span>
<span>FULLTEXT</span>
<span>index enables natural-language queries to find keywords, wherever</span>

<span>engine.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>A</span>
<span>stopword</span>
<span>is a word that is so common that it is considered not worth including</span>
<span>in a</span>
<span>FULLTEXT</span>
<span>index or using in searches. However, it does participate in a search</span>
<span>when it is part of a larger string bounded by double quotes.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>SELECT DISTINCT</span>
<span>essentially affects only the display, choosing a single row and</span>
<span>eliminating all the duplicates.</span>
<span>GROUP BY</span>
<span>does not eliminate rows, but combines all</span>
<span>the rows that have the same value in the column. Therefore,</span>
<span>GROUP BY</span>
<span>is useful for</span>
<span>performing an operation such as</span>
<span>COUNT</span>
<span>on groups of rows.</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
<span>DISTINCT</span>
<span>is not</span>

<span>The term</span>
<span>relationship</span>
<span>refers to the connection between two pieces of data that have</span>
<span>some association, such as a book and its author, or a book and the customer who</span>
<span>bought the book. A relational database such as MySQL specializes in storing and</span>
<span>retrieving such relations.</span>

<span>The process of removing duplicate data and optimizing tables is called</span>
<span>normaliza‐</span>

<span>3.</span>
<span>The three rules of First Normal Form are as follows:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>There should be no repeating columns containing the same kind of data.</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>All columns should contain a single value.</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>There should be a primary key to uniquely identify each row.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To satisfy Second Normal Form, columns whose data repeats across multiple rows</span>
<span>should be removed to their own tables.</span>

<span>The</span>

<span>The most noticeable difference between Boolean values in PHP and JavaScript is</span>
<span>that PHP recognizes the keywords</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>false</span>
<span>, whereas only</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>false</span>
<span>are supported in JavaScript. Additionally, in PHP,</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>has a value</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>; in JavaScript they are represented by</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>false</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>which can be returned as string values.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>Unlike PHP, no character is used (such as</span>
<span>$</span>
<span>) to define a JavaScript variable name.</span>
<span>JavaScript variable names can start with and contain uppercase and lowercase let‐</span>
<span>ters as well as underscores; names can also include digits, but not as the first char‐</span>
<span>acter.</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>The difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators is the number of</span>
<span>operands each requires (one, two, and three, respectively).</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>The best way to force your own operator precedence is to surround the parts of an</span>
<span>expression to be evaluated first with parentheses.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>You use the identity operator when you wish to bypass JavaScript&rsquo;s automatic</span>
<span>operand type changing.</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>The simplest forms of expressions are literals (such as numbers and strings) and</span>
<span>variables, which simply evaluate to themselves.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>The three conditional statement types are</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>, and the</span>
<span>?:</span>
<span>operator.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>Most conditional expressions in</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>statements are literal or Boolean and</span>
<span>therefore trigger execution when they evaluate to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. Numeric expressions trig‐</span>
<span>ger execution when they evaluate to a nonzero value. String expressions trigger</span>
<span>execution when they evaluate to a nonempty string. A</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>value is evaluated as</span>
<span>false and therefore does not trigger execution.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>Loops using</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statements are more powerful than</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loops, because they sup‐</span>
<span>port two additional parameters to control loop handling.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>with</span>
<span>statement takes an object as its parameter. Using it, you specify an object</span>
<span>once; then for each statement within the</span>
<span>with</span>
<span>block, that object is assumed.</span>

<span>In CSS, the semicolon is used as a separator between declarations.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>To add a comment to a style sheet, you enclose it between</span>
<span>/*</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>*/</span>
<span>opening and</span>

<span>To select a group of different elements and/or element types in CSS, you place a</span>
<span>comma between each element, ID, or class.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>Given a pair of CSS declarations with equal precedence, to make one have</span>
<span>greater precedence over the other, you append the</span>
<span>!important</span>

<span>The CSS3 operators</span>
<span>^=</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>$=</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>*=</span>
<span>match the start, end, or any portion of a string,</span>
<span>respectively.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>The property you use to specify the size of a background image is</span>
<span>background-</span>
<span>size</span>
<span>, like this:</span>
<span>background-size:800px 600px;</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>You can specify the radius of a border using the</span>
<span>border-radius</span>
<span>property:</span>
<span>border-radius:20px;</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To flow text over multiple columns, you use the</span>
<span>column-count</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>column-gap</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>column-rule</span>
<span>properties or their browser-specific variants, like this:</span>
<span>column-count:3;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>column-gap :1em;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>column-rule :1px solid black;</span>

<span>The four functions with which you can specify CSS colors are</span>
<span>hsl</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>hsla</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>rgb</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>rgba</span>
<span>; for example:</span>
<span>color:rgba(0%,60%,40%,0.4);</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>To create a gray text shadow under some text, offset diagonally to the bottom</span>
<span>right by 5 pixels, with a blurring of 3 pixels, you would use this declaration:</span>
<span>text-shadow:5px 5px 3px #888;</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>You can indicate that text is truncated with an ellipsis by using this declaration:</span>
<span>text-overflow:ellipsis;</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>You include a Google Web Font in a web page by first selecting it from</span>
<span>http://</span>
<span>google.com/fonts</span>
<span>. Then assuming, for example, you chose Lobster, include it in</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>&lt;link&gt;</span>
<span>tag, like this:</span>
<span>&lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster'</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;</span>
<span>and also refer to the font in a CSS declaration such as this:</span>
<span>h1 { font-family:'Lobster', arial, serif; }</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>The CSS declaration you would you use to rotate an object by 90 degrees is:</span>
<span>transform:rotate(90deg);</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>To set up a transition on an object so that when any of its properties are</span>
<span>changed the change will transition immediately in a linear fashion over the</span>
<span>course of half a second, you would use this declaration:</span>
<span>transition:all .5s linear;</span>

<span>The</span>
<span>O</span>
<span>function returns an object by its ID, the</span>
<span>S</span>
<span>function returns the</span>
<span>style</span>
<span>prop‐</span>
<span>erty of an object, and the</span>
<span>C</span>
<span>function returns an array of all objects that access a</span>
<span>given class.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>You can modify a CSS attribute of an object using the</span>
<span>setAttribute</span>
<span>function,</span>
<span>like this:</span>
<span>myobject.setAttribute('font-size', '16pt')</span>
<span>You can also (usually) modify an attribute directly (using slightly modified</span>
<span>property names where required), like this:</span>
<span>myobject.fontSize = '16pt'</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>The properties that provide the width and height available in a browser window</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>window.innerHeight</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>window.innerWidth</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To make something happen when the mouse passes over and out of an object,</span>
<span>attach to the</span>
<span>onmouseover</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>onmouseout</span>
<span>events.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>To create a new element, use code such as this:</span>
<span>elem = document.createElement('span')</span>
<span>To add the new element to the DOM, use code such as this:</span>
<span>document.body.appendChild(elem)</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>To make an element invisible, set its</span>
<span>visibility</span>
<span>property to</span>
<span>hidden</span>
<span>(or</span>
<span>visible</span>
<span>to restore it again). To collapse an element&rsquo;s dimensions to zero, set its</span>
<span>display</span>
<span>property to</span>
<span>none</span>
<span>(the value</span>
<span>block</span>
<span>is one way to restore it).</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>To set a single event at a future time, call the</span>
<span>setTimeout</span>
<span>function, passing it the</span>
<span>code or function name to execute and the time delay in milliseconds.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>To set up repeating events at regular intervals, use the</span>
<span>setInterval</span>
<span>function, pass‐</span>
<span>ing it the code or function name to execute and the time delay between repeats in</span>
<span>milliseconds.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>To release an element from its location in a web page to enable it to be moved</span>
<span>around, set its</span>
<span>position</span>
<span>property to</span>
<span>relative</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>absolute</span>
<span>, or</span>
<span>fixed</span>
<span>. To restore it to</span>
<span>its original place, set the property to</span>
<span>static</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>To achieve an animation rate of 50 frames per second, you should set a delay</span>
<span>between interrupts of 20 milliseconds. To calculate this value, divide 1,000 milli‐</span>
<span>seconds by the desired frame rate.</span>

<span>The symbol commonly used as the factory method for creating jQuery objects is</span>
<span>$</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Alternatively, you can use the method name</span>
<span>jQuery</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>To link to minified release 1.11.1 of jQuery from the Google CDN, you could</span>
<span>use HTML such as this:</span>
<span>&lt;script src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/</span>
<span>1.11.1/jquery.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>The jQuery</span>
<span>$</span>
<span>factory method accepts CSS selectors in order to build a jQuery</span>
<span>object of matching elements.</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>To get a CSS property value, use the</span>
<span>css</span>
<span>method, supplying just a property name.</span>
<span>To set the property&rsquo;s value, supply a property name and a value to the method.</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>To attach a method to the element</span>
<span>elem</span>
<span>&rsquo;</span>
<span>s click event to make it slowly hide,</span>
<span>you could use code such as the following:</span>
<span>$('#elem').click(function() { $(this).hide('slow') } )</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>In order to be able to animate an element, you must assign a value of</span>
<span>fixed</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>rela</span>
<span>tive</span>
<span>, or</span>
<span>absolute</span>
<span>to its</span>
<span>position</span>
<span>property.</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>Methods can be run at once (or sequentially if animations) by chaining them</span>
<span>together with periods, like this:</span>
<span>$('#elem').css('color', 'blue').css('background',</span>
<span>'yellow').slideUp('slow')</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>To retrieve an element object from a jQuery selection object, you can index it with</span>
<span>square brackets, like this</span>
<span>$('#elem')[0]</span>
<span>, or use the</span>
<span>get</span>
<span>method, like this:</span>
<span>$</span>
<span>('#elem').get(0)</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>To display the sibling element immediately preceding one with the ID of</span>
<span>news</span>
<span>in bold, you could use this statement:</span>
<span>$('#news').prev().css('font-weight', 'bold')</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>You can make a jQuery Ajax Get request using the</span>
<span>$.get</span>
<span>method, like this:</span>

<span>To create a canvas element in HTML, use a</span>
<span>&lt;canvas&gt;</span>
<span>tag and specify an ID</span>
<span>that JavaScript can use to access it, like this:</span>
<span>&lt;canvas id='mycanvas'&gt;</span>
<span>2.</span>
<span>To give JavaScript access to a canvas element, ensure the element has been</span>
<span>given an ID such as</span>
<span>mycanvas</span>
<span>, and then use the</span>
<span>document.getElementdById</span>
<span>function (or the</span>
<span>O</span>
<span>function from the</span>
<span>&nbsp;OSC.js</span>
<span>&nbsp;file supplied on the companion</span>
<span>website) to return an object to the element. Finally, call</span>
<span>getContext</span>
<span>on the</span>
<span>object to retrieve a 2D context to the canvas, like this:</span>
<span>canvas = document.getElementById('mycanvas')</span>
<span>context = canvas.getContext('2d')</span>
<span>3.</span>
<span>To start a canvas path, issue the</span>
<span>beginPath</span>
<span>method on the context. After creat‐</span>
<span>ing a path, you close it by issuing</span>
<span>closePath</span>
<span>on the context, like this:</span>
<span>context.beginPath()</span>
<span>// Path creation commands go here</span>
<span>context.closePath()</span>
<span>4.</span>
<span>You can extract the data from a canvas using the</span>
<span>toDataURL</span>
<span>method, which</span>
<span>can then be assigned to the</span>
<span>src</span>
<span>property of an image object, like this:</span>
<span>image.src = canvas.toDataURL()</span>
<span>5.</span>
<span>To create a gradient fill (either radial or linear) with more than two colors,</span>
<span>specify all the colors required as stop colors assigned to a gradient object you</span>
<span>have already created, and assign them each a starting point as a percent value</span>
<span>of the complete gradient (between</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>), like this:</span>
<span>gradient.addColorStop(0, 'green')</span>
<span>gradient.addColorStop(0.3, 'red')</span>
<span>gradient.addColorStop(0,79, 'orange')</span>
<span>gradient.addColorStop(1, 'brown')</span>
<span>6.</span>
<span>To adjust the width of drawn lines, assign a value to the</span>
<span>lineWidth</span>
<span>property of</span>
<span>the context, like this:</span>
<span>context.lineWidth = 5</span>
<span>7.</span>
<span>To ensure that future drawing takes place only within a certain area, you can create</span>
<span>a path and then call the</span>
<span>clip</span>
<span>method.</span>
<span>8.</span>
<span>A complex curve with two imaginary attractors is called a B&eacute;zier curve. To create</span>
<span>one, call the</span>
<span>bezierCurveTo</span>
<span>method, supplying two pairs of</span>
<span>x</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>y</span>
<span>coordinates</span>
<span>for the attractors, followed by another pair for the end point of the curve. A curve</span>
<span>is then created from the current drawing location to the destination.</span>
<span>9.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>getImageData</span>
<span>method returns an array containing the specified pixel data,</span>
<span>with the elements consecutively containing the red, green, blue, and alpha pixel</span>
<span>values, so four items of data are returned per pixel.</span>
<span>10.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>transform</span>
<span>method takes six arguments (or parameters), which are in order:</span>
<span>horizontal scale, horizontal skew, vertical skew, vertical scale, horizontal translate,</span>
<span>and vertical translate. Therefore, the arguments that apply to scaling are numbers 1</span>

<span>receiving them, like this for posting:</span>
<span>postMessage(message, 'http://mydomain.com')</span>
<span>And this for receiving:</span>
<span>if (event.origin) != 'http://mydomain.com') // Disallow</span>
<span>You can also encrypt or obscure communications to discourage injection or</span>
<span>eavesdropping.</span>

<span>sidered so common as to not be worth searching for, or storing, in a</span>
<span>FULLTEXT</span>
<span>index.</span>
<span>Theoretically, ignoring these words makes little difference to the results of most</span>
<span>FULL</span>
<span>TEXT</span>
<span>searches, but makes MySQL databases considerably smaller and more efficient.</span>
<span>The words are shown here in lowercase but apply to uppercase and mixed-case ver‐</span>
<span>sions, too:</span>

<h2>MySQL Functions</h2>
<span>Having functions built into MySQL substantially reduces the speed of performing</span>
<span>complex queries, as well as their complexity. If you wish to learn more about the</span>
<span>available functions, you can visit the following URLs:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>String functions:</span>
<span>tinyurl.com/phpstringfuncs</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Date and time:</span>
<span>tinyurl.com/phpdateandtime</span>
<span>But, for easy reference, here are some of the most commonly used MySQL functions.</span>
<h3>String Functions</h3>
<span>CONCAT(</span>
<span>str1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>str2</span>
<span>, ...)</span>
<span>Returns the result of concatenating</span>
<span>str1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>str2</span>
<span>, and any other parameters (or</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>if any argument is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>). If any of the arguments are binary, then the result</span>
<span>is a binary string; otherwise, the result is a nonbinary string. The code returns</span>
<span>the string</span>
<span>"MySQL"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');</span>
<span>CONCAT_WS(</span>
<span>separator</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>str1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>str2</span>
<span>, ...)</span>
<span>This works in the same way as</span>
<span>CONCAT</span>
<span>except it inserts a separator between the</span>
<span>items being concatenated. If the separator is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, the result will be</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, but</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>values can be used as other arguments, which will then be skipped. This</span>
<span>code returns the string</span>
<span>"Truman,Harry,S"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', 'Truman', 'Harry', 'S');</span>
<span>LEFT(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the leftmost</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>characters from the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>(or</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>if any argument</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>). The following code returns the string</span>
<span>"Chris"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT LEFT('Christopher Columbus', '5');</span>
<span>RIGHT(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the rightmost</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>characters from the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>(or</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>if any argu‐</span>
<span>ment is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>). This code returns the string</span>
<span>"Columbus"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT RIGHT('Christopher Columbus', '8');</span>
<span>MID(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns up to</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>characters from the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>starting at position</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>. If</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>omitted, then all characters up to the end of the string are returned. You may use</span>
<span>a negative value for</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>, in which case it represents the character</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>places from</span>
<span>the end of the string. The first position in the string is</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>. This code returns the</span>
<span>string</span>
<span>"stop"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT MID('Christopher Columbus', '5', '4');</span>
<span>LENGTH(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the length in bytes of the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>. Note that multibyte characters</span>
<span>count as multiple bytes. If you need to know the actual number of characters in a</span>
<span>string, use the</span>
<span>CHAR_LENGTH</span>
<span>function. This code returns the value</span>
<span>15</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT LENGTH('Mark Zuckerberg');</span>
<span>LPAD(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>padstr</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>padded to a length of</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>characters by prepending the</span>
<span>string with</span>
<span>padstr</span>
<span>characters. If</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>is longer than</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>, the string returned will</span>
<span>be truncated to</span>
<span>len</span>
<span>characters. The example code returns these strings:</span>
<span>January</span>
<span>February</span>
<span>March</span>
<span>April</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>May</span>
<span>Notice how all the strings have been padded to be eight characters long:</span>
<span>SELECT LPAD('January', '8', ' ');</span>
<span>SELECT LPAD('February', '8', ' ');</span>
<span>SELECT LPAD('March', '8', ' ');</span>
<span>SELECT LPAD('April', '8', ' ');</span>
<span>SELECT LPAD('May', '8', ' ');</span>
<span>RPAD</span>
<span>This is the same as the</span>
<span>LPAD</span>
<span>function except that the padding takes place on the</span>
<span>right of the returned string. This code returns the string</span>
<span>"Hi!!!"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT RPAD('Hi', '5', '!');</span>
<span>LOCATE(</span>
<span>substr</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the position of the first occurrence of</span>
<span>substr</span>
<span>in the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>. If the</span>
<span>parameter</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>is passed, the search begins at position</span>
<span>pos</span>
<span>. If</span>
<span>substr</span>
<span>is not found</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>, a value of</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>is returned. This code returns the values</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>11</span>
<span>, because the</span>
<span>first function call returns the first encounter of the word</span>
<span>unit</span>
<span>, while the second</span>
<span>one only starts to search at the seventh character, and so returns the second</span>
<span>instance:</span>
<span>SELECT LOCATE('unit', 'Community unit');</span>
<span>SELECT LOCATE('unit', 'Community unit' 7);</span>
<span>LOWER(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>This is the inverse of</span>
<span>UPPER</span>
<span>. Returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>with all the characters</span>
<span>changed to lowercase. This code returns the string</span>
<span>"queen elizabeth ii"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT LOWER('Queen Elizabeth II');</span>
<span>UPPER(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>This is the inverse of</span>
<span>LOWER</span>
<span>. It returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>with all the characters</span>
<span>changed to uppercase. This code returns the string</span>
<span>"I CAN'T HELP SHOUTING"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT UPPER("I can't help shouting");</span>
<span>QUOTE(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns a quoted string that can be used as a properly escaped value in a SQL</span>
<span>statement. The returned string is enclosed in single quotes with all instances of</span>
<span>single quotes, backslashes, the ASCII</span>
<span>NUL</span>
<span>character, and Control-Z preceded by a</span>
<span>backslash. If the argument</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, the return value is the word</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>without</span>
<span>enclosing quotes. The example code returns the following string:</span>
<span>'I\'m hungry'</span>
<span>Note how the</span>
<span>"</span>
<span>symbol has been replaced with</span>
<span>\'</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>SELECT QUOTE("I'm hungry");</span>
<span>REPEAT(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>count</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns a string comprising</span>
<span>count</span>
<span>copies of the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>. If</span>
<span>count</span>
<span>is less than 1,</span>
<span>an empty string is returned. If either parameter is</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, then</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>is returned.</span>
<span>This code returns the strings</span>
<span>"Ho Ho Ho"</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>"Merry Christmas"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT REPEAT('Ho ', 3), 'Merry Christmas';</span>
<span>REPLACE(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>from</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>with all occurrences of the string</span>
<span>from</span>
<span>replaced with the</span>
<span>string</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>. The search and replace is case-sensitive when searching for</span>
<span>from</span>
<span>. This</span>
<span>code returns the string</span>
<span>"Cheeseburger and Soda"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT REPLACE('Cheeseburger and Fries', 'Fries', 'Soda');</span>
<span>TRIM([</span>
<span>specifier remove</span>
<span>FROM]</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>with all prefixes or suffixes removed. The</span>
<span>specifier</span>
<span>can</span>
<span>be one of</span>
<span>BOTH</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>LEADING</span>
<span>, or</span>
<span>TRAILING</span>
<span>. If no</span>
<span>specifier</span>
<span>is supplied, then</span>
<span>BOTH</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>assumed. The</span>
<span>remove</span>
<span>string is optional and, if omitted, spaces are removed. This</span>
<span>code returns the strings</span>
<span>"No Padding"</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>"Hello__"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT TRIM(' No Padding ');</span>
<span>SELECT TRIM(LEADING '_' FROM '__Hello__');</span>
<span>LTRIM(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>) and RTRIM(</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>The function</span>
<span>RTRIM</span>
<span>returns the string</span>
<span>str</span>
<span>with any leading spaces removed,</span>
<span>while the function</span>
<span>RTRIM</span>
<span>performs the same action on the string&rsquo;s tail. This code</span>
<span>returns the strings</span>
<span>"No Padding"</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>"No Padding"</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT LTRIM(' No Padding ');</span>
<span>SELECT RTRIM(' No Padding ');</span>
<h3>Date Functions</h3>
<span>Dates are an important part of most databases. Whenever financial transactions take</span>
<span>place, the date has to be recorded, expiry dates of credit cards need to be noted for</span>
<span>repeat billing purposes, and so on. So, as you might expect, MySQL comes with a</span>
<span>wide variety of functions to make handling dates a breeze.</span>
<span>CURDATE()</span>
<span>Returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYMMDD format, depending</span>
<span>on whether the function is used in a numeric or string context. On the date May</span>
<span>2, 2018, the following code returns the values</span>
<span>2018-05-02</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>20180502:</span>
<span>SELECT CURDATE();</span>
<span>SELECT CURDATE() + 0;</span>
<span>DATE(</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Extracts the date part of the date or a</span>
<span>DATETIME</span>
<span>expression</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>. This code</span>
<span>returns the value</span>
<span>1961-05-02</span>
<span>:</span>
<span>SELECT DATE('1961-05-02 14:56:23');</span>
<span>DATE_ADD(</span>
<span>date</span>
<span>, INTERVAL</span>
<span>expr unit</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>Returns the result of adding the expression</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>using units</span>
<span>unit</span>
<span>to the</span>
<span>date</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>date</span>
<span>argument is the starting date or</span>
<span>DATETIME</span>
<span>value, and</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>may start</span>
<span>with a</span>
<span>-</span>
<span>symbol for negative intervals.</span>
<span>&nbsp;Table D-1</span>
<span>shows the interval types sup‐</span>
<span>ported and the expected</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>values. Note the examples in this table that show</span>
<span>where it is necessary to surround the</span>
<span>expr</span>
<span>value with quotes for MySQL to cor‐</span>
<span>rectly interpret them. If you are ever in doubt, adding the quotes will always</span>
<span>work.</span>

<span>You can also use the</span>
<span>DATE_SUB</span>
<span>function to subtract date intervals. However, it&rsquo;s</span>
<span>not actually necessary for you to use the</span>
<span>DATE_ADD</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>DATE_SUB</span>
<span>functions, as you</span>
<span>can use date arithmetic directly in MySQL. This code:</span>
<span>SELECT DATE_ADD('1975-01-01', INTERVAL 77 DAY);</span>
<span>SELECT DATE_SUB('1982-07-04', INTERVAL '3-11' YEAR_MONTH);</span>
<span>SELECT '2018-12-31 23:59:59' + INTERVAL 1 SECOND;</span>
<span>SELECT '2000-01-01' - INTERVAL 1 SECOND;</span>
<span>returns the following values:</span>
<span>1975-03-19</span>
<span>1978-08-04</span>
<span>2019-01-01 00:00:00</span>
<span>1999-12-31 23:59:59</span>
<span>Notice how the last two commands use date arithmetic directly without recourse</span>
<span>to functions.</span>
<span>DATE_FORMAT(</span>
<span>date</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>format</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>This returns the</span>
<span>date</span>
<span>value formatted according to the</span>
<span>format</span>
<span>string.</span>
<span>Table D-2</span>
<span>shows the specifiers that can be used in the</span>
<span>format</span>
<span>string. Note that the</span>
<span>%</span>
<span>charac‐</span>
<span>ter is required before each specifier, as shown. This code returns the given date</span>
<span>and time as</span>
<span>Friday May 4th 2018 03:02 AM</span>
<span>:</span>

<h2>jQuery Selectors, Objects, and Methods</h2>
<span>Chapter 21</span>
<span>&nbsp;gives you a good grounding in using the jQuery JavaScript Library. To</span>
<span>help get you started with using jQuery to the best effect, here&rsquo;s a comprehensive list of</span>
<span>the selectors, objects, and methods it uses, a number of which there wasn&rsquo;t room to</span>
<span>introduce in this book, but you are ready for them, because you should now know</span>
<span>enough to be able to use them correctly.</span>
<span>Please bear in mind, though, that sometimes new features are added, bugs are fixed,</span>
<span>and other features can become deprecated or removed. So you can keep up-to-date</span>
<span>with the latest developments, information on deprecated or removed features (not</span>
<span>detailed here), and newer releases of jQuery, at</span>
<span>jquery.com</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>api.jquery.com</span>

<h4>Colophon</h4>
<span>The animals on the cover of</span>
<span>Learning PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, &amp; HTML5</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>sugar gliders (</span>
<span>Petaurus breviceps</span>
<span>). Sugar gliders are small, gray-furred creatures that</span>
<span>grow to an adult length of 6 to 7.5 inches. Their tails, which are distinguished by a</span>
<span>black tip, are usually as long as their bodies. Membranes extend between their wrists</span>
<span>and ankles and provide an aerodynamic surface that helps them glide between trees.</span>
<span>Sugar gliders are native to Australia and Tasmania. They prefer to live in the hollow</span>
<span>parts of eucalyptus and other types of large trees with several other adult sugar gliders</span>
<span>and their own children.</span>
<span>Though sugar gliders reside in groups and defend their territory together, they don&rsquo;t</span>
<span>always live in harmony. One male will assert his dominance by marking the group&rsquo;s</span>
<span>territory with his saliva and then by marking all group members with a distinctive</span>
<span>scent produced from his forehead and chest glands. This ensures that members of the</span>
<span>group will know when an outsider approaches; group members will fight off any</span>
<span>sugar glider not bearing their scent. However, a sugar glider group will welcome and</span>
<span>mark an outsider if one of their adult males dies (the group will typically replace a</span>
<span>deceased adult female with one of their own female offspring).</span>
<span>Sugar gliders make popular pets because of their inquisitive, playful natures, and</span>
<span>because many think they are cute. But there are disadvantages to keeping sugar glid‐</span>
<span>ers as pets: as they are exotic animals, sugar gliders need specialized, complicated</span>
<span>diets consisting of items such as crickets, a variety of fruits and vegetables, and meal‐</span>
<span>worms; healthy housing requires a cage or space no less than the size of an aviary;</span>
<span>their distinctive scents can be bothersome to humans; as they are nocturnal creatures,</span>
<span>they will bark, hiss, run, and glide all night long; it&rsquo;s not uncommon for them to lose</span>
<span>control of their bowels while playing or eating; and in some states and countries, it is</span>
<span>illegal to own sugar gliders as household pets.</span>
