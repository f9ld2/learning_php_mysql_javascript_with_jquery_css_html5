    <h2 class="title">Bug reports</h2>
    <p class="simpara">
     If you think you have found a bug in PHP, please report it.  The
     PHP developers probably don&apos;t know about it, and unless you
     report it, chances are it won&apos;t be fixed. You can report bugs
     using the bug-tracking system at <a href="http://bugs.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://bugs.php.net/</a>. Please do not
     send bug reports in mailing list or personal letters. The
     bug system is also suitable to submit feature requests.
