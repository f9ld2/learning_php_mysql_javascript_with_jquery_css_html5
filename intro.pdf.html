   The PDF functions in PHP can create PDF files using the PDFlib 
   library from PDFlib GmbH (<a href="http://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib-family/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;www.pdflib.com</a>).
   A restricted version called PDFlib Lite 7 is available for free,
   but it is no longer maintained since 2010.
   PDFlib integration for PHP is still actively maintained by PDFlib GmbH.
   It is mainly targeted at the commercial PDFlib versions, but can also
   be used for the old PDFlib Lite.

  <p class="para">
  If you want to use PDFlib we urge you start with the examples which are 
  included in all PDFlib packages, and refer to the extensive manuals in 
  PDF format which are also included. At a minimum you should take a look 
  at the hello.php sample to learn basic setup for PDFlib usage.
