 <h1>Expiration Times</h1>

 <p class="para">
  Some storage commands involve sending an expiration value (relative to an
  item or to an operation requested by the client) to the server. In all such
  cases, the actual value sent may either be Unix time (number of seconds
  since January 1, 1970, as an integer), or a number of seconds starting from
  current time. In the latter case, this number of seconds may not exceed
  60*60*24*30 (number of seconds in 30 days); if the expiration value is
  larger than that, the server will consider it to be real Unix time value
  rather than an offset from current time.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  If the expiration value is <em>0</em> (the default), the item
  never expires (although it may be deleted from the server to make place for
  other items).
