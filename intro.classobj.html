   These functions allow you to obtain information about classes
   and instance objects. You can obtain the name of the class to
   which an object belongs, as well as its member properties and 
   methods. Using these functions, you can find out not only the
   class membership of an object, but also its parentage (i.e.
   what class is the object class extending).

   Please see the <a href="language.types.object.html" class="link">Objects</a>
   section of the manual for a detailed explanation of how classes and
   objects are implemented and used in PHP.
