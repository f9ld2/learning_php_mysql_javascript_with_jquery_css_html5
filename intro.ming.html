  <p class="para">
   First of all: Ming is not an acronym. Ming is an open-source (LGPL)
   library which allows you to create SWF (&quot;Flash&quot;) format movies. Ming
   supports almost all of Flash 4&apos;s features, including: shapes, gradients,
   bitmaps (pngs and jpegs), morphs (&quot;shape tweens&quot;), text, buttons,
   actions, sprites (&quot;movie clips&quot;), streaming mp3, and color transforms
   --the only thing that&apos;s missing is sound events.

  <p class="para">
   Note that all values specifying length, distance, size, etc. are in &quot;twips&quot;, 
   twenty units per pixel. That&apos;s pretty much arbitrary, though, since the player
   scales the movie to whatever pixel size is specified in the embed/object tag, 
   or the entire frame if not embedded.

   Ming offers a number of advantages over the existing
   PHP/libswf module.
   You can use Ming anywhere you can compile the code, whereas libswf is
   closed-source and only available for a few platforms, Windows not one of
   them. Ming provides some insulation from the mundane details of the SWF
   file format, wrapping the movie elements in PHP objects. Also, Ming is
   still being maintained; if there&apos;s a feature that you want to see, just
   let us know at <a href="http://www.libming.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://www.libming.org/</a>.
