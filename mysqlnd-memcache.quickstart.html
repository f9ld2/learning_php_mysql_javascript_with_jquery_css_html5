  started.

 <p class="para">
  It is strongly recommended to read the reference sections in addition to the
  quickstart. The quickstart tries to avoid discussing theoretical concepts
  and limitations. Instead, it will link to the reference sections. It is safe
  to begin with the quickstart. However, before using the plugin in mission critical
  environments we urge you to read additionally the background information from the
  reference sections.
