   There are two resource types used in the FAM module. The first one is
   the connection to the FAM service returned by 
   <span class="function"><a href="function.fam-open.html" class="function">fam_open()</a></span>, the second a monitoring resource returned
   by the <em>fam_monitor_XXX</em> functions.
