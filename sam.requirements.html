   The SAM extension interfaces to the IBM Messaging and Queuing
   middleware products using a set of libraries and some client side code
   referred to as XMS. This package is available as a free download in
   the guise of IBM support pack IA94. There is a description of this
   package and download links in the article <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24007092" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;
   Introducing XMS - The IBM Message Service API</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   If you intend to use SAM to access the Messaging and Queuing
   infrastructure within WebSphere MQ then you will also need to have
   installed a local MQ queue manager or installed the WebSphere MQ
   clients package. The clients package is freely available as a support
   pack (<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171&amp;uid=swg24009961&amp;loc=en_US&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;lang=en" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;MQC6</a>).
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   If you are only aiming to experiment with sending messages to and from
   WebSphere Application Server queues using the <em>WebSphere Platform
   Messaging protocol (WPM)</em> then you do not need to install the MQC6
   package.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   After installing these packages you will need to ensure the XMS binary
   and, if you are using it, the MQ client bin directory are included in
   the <span class="envar">PATH</span> environment variable so that Apache and PHP can
   find the dependent .DLLs/libraries.
