   APD is the Advanced PHP Debugger. It was written to provide profiling and
   debugging capabilities for PHP code, as well as to provide the ability to
   print out a full stack backtrace. APD supports interactive debugging, but
   by default it writes data to trace files. It also offers event based
   logging so that varying levels of information (including function calls,
   arguments passed, timings, etc.) can be turned on or off for individual
   scripts.

    APD is a Zend Extension, modifying the way the internals of PHP handle 
    function calls, and thus may or may not be compatible with other Zend 
    Extensions (for example Zend Optimizer).
