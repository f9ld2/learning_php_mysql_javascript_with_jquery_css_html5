  <h2 class="title">Compiling shared PECL extensions with phpize</h2>
  <p class="simpara">
   Sometimes, using the <em>pecl</em> installer is not an option.
   This could be because you&apos;re behind a firewall, or it could be because the
   extension you want to install is not available as a PECL compatible
   package, such as unreleased extensions from SVN.  If you need to build such
   an extension, you can use the lower-level build tools to perform the build
   manually.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   The <em>phpize</em> command is used to prepare the build
   environment for a PHP extension.  In the following sample, the sources for
   an extension are in a directory named <var class="filename">extname</var>:
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <div class="example-contents screen">
<div class="cdata"><pre>
$ cd extname
$ phpize
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
</pre></div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   A successful install will have created <var class="filename">extname.so</var> and put it 
   into the PHP 
   <a href="ini.core.html#ini.extension-dir" class="link">extensions directory</a>.  You&apos;ll need
   to and adjust <var class="filename">php.ini</var> and add an <em>extension=extname.so</em>
   line before you can use the extension.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   If the system is missing the <em>phpize</em> command, and precompiled
   packages (like RPM&apos;s) are used, be sure to also install the appropriate 
   devel version of the PHP package as they often include the 
   <em>phpize</em> command along with the appropriate header files to 
   build PHP and its extensions.

   Execute <strong class="command">phpize --help</strong> to display additional usage information.
