  <h2 class="title">Translations</h2>
  <p class="para">
   The PHP manual is available not only in various formats, but
   also in various languages. The text of the 
   manual is first written in English, then teams of people across 
   the world take care of translating it to their native languages.
   If a translation for a specified function or chapter has not yet
   been made, the manual&apos;s build system falls back to the 
   English version of it.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   People involved in the translations start from the <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym>
   source code available from <a href="http://svn.php.net/viewvc/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://svn.php.net/viewvc/</a>
   and from it they translate to their mother language. They do 
   <em class="emphasis">not use</em> the generated versions (like 
   <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> or plain text) as it&apos;s the build system that takes 
   care of the conversions from <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> to human readable 
   formats.
