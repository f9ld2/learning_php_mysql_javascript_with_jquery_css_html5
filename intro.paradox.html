  <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="para">
   This module allows to read and write Paradox databases, primary index
   files and blob files. Write support has been proven to be quite reliable,
   though due to lack of documentation the produced files may not in
   any case be readable by other applications. Encrypted databases can
   be read without specifying a password if pxlib &gt;= 0.5.0 is used.

    This module is also in development and may change, though major changes to
    the API are not expected.
