  <h2 class="title">Building on Win32</h2>
  <p class="para">
   To build APD under Windows you need a working PHP compilation
   environment as described on http://php.net/ -- basically, it requires
   you to have Microsoft Visual C++, win32build.zip, bison/flex, and some know how
   to get it to work. Also ensure that adp.dsp has DOS line endings; if it has unix
   line endings, Microsoft Visual C++ will complain about it.
