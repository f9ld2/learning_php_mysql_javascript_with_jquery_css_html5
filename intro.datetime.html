  <p class="para">
   These functions allow you to get the date and time from the server
   where your PHP scripts are running. You can use these functions to format the
   date and time in many different ways.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The date and time information is internally stored as a 64-bit number so
   all conceivably useful dates (including negative years) are supported. The range is from about 292
   billion years in the past to the same in the future.

   <span class="simpara">
    Please keep in mind that these functions are dependent on
    the locale settings of your server. Make sure to take
    daylight saving time (use e.g.
    <em>$date = strtotime(&apos;+7 days&apos;, $date)</em> and not
    <em>$date += 7*24*60*60</em>)
    and leap years into consideration when working
    with these functions.
