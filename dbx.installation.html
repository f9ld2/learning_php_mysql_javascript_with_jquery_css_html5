  In order to have these functions available, you must compile PHP with
  dbx support by using the <strong class="option configure">--enable-dbx</strong>

  option and all options for the databases that will be used, e.g. for
  MySQL you must also specify
  <strong class="option configure">--with-mysql=[DIR]</strong>
.
  To get other supported databases to work with the dbx-module refer to their
  specific documentation.
