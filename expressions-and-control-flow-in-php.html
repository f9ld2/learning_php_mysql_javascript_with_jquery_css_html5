<h2>Expressions and Control Flow in PHP</h2>
<span>The previous chapter introduced several topics in passing that this chapter covers</span>
<span>more fully, such as making choices (branching) and creating complex expressions. In</span>
<span>the previous chapter, I wanted to focus on the most basic syntax and operations in</span>
<span>PHP, but I couldn&rsquo;t avoid touching on more-advanced topics. Now I can fill in the</span>
<span>background that you need to use these powerful PHP features properly.</span>
<br/>
<span>In this chapter, you will get a thorough grounding in how PHP programming works</span>
<span>in practice and in how to control the flow of the program.</span>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<span>Let&rsquo;s start with the most fundamental part of any programming language:</span>
<span>expressions</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that</span>
<span>results in a value. It&rsquo;s familiar to anyone who has taken high-school algebra:</span>
<br/>
<span>y</span>
<span>= 3(abs(2</span>
<span>x</span>
<span>) + 4)</span>
<br/>
<span>which in PHP would be</span>
<pre><code class="php">$y = 3 * (abs(2 * $x) + 4);</code></pre>
<span>The value returned (</span>
<span>y</span>
<span>, or</span>
<span>$y</span>
<span>in this case) can be a number, a string, or a</span>
<span>Boolean value</span>
<span>(named after George Boole, a 19th-century English mathematician and philosopher).</span>
<span>By now, you should be familiar with the first two value types, but I&rsquo;ll explain the</span>
<span>third.</span>
<h4>TRUE or FALSE?</h4>
<span>A basic Boolean value can be either</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>. For example, the expression</span>
<span>20 &gt;</span>
<span>9</span>
<span>(20 is greater than 9) is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, and the expression</span>
<span>5 == 6</span>
<span>(5 is equal to 6) is</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>(You can combine Boolean operations using operators such as</span>
<span>AND</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>OR</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>XOR</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>which are covered later in this chapter.)</span>
<br/>
<span>Note that I am using uppercase letters for the names</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>. This is because they are predefined constants in PHP. You</span>
<span>can also use the lowercase versions, if you prefer, as they are also</span>
<span>predefined. In fact, the lowercase versions are more stable, because</span>
<span>PHP does not allow you to redefine them; the uppercase ones may</span>
<span>be redefined&mdash;something you should bear in mind if you import</span>
<span>third-party code.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-1</span>
<span>shows some simple expressions: the two I just mentioned, plus a couple</span>
<span>more. For each line, it prints out a letter between</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>d</span>
<span>, followed by a colon and the</span>
<span>result of the expressions. The</span>
<span>&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>tag is there to create a line break and thus separate</span>
<span>the output into four lines in HTML.</span>
<br/>
<span>Now that we are fully into the age of HTML5, and XHTML is no</span>
<span>longer being planned to supersede HTML, you do not need to use</span>
<span>the self-closing</span>
<span>&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span>form of the</span>
<span>&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>tag, or any void elements</span>
<span>(ones without closing tags), because the</span>
<span>/</span>
<span>is now optional. There‚Äê</span>
<span>fore, I have chosen to use the simpler style in this book. If you ever</span>
<span>made HTML nonvoid tags self-closing (such as</span>
<span>&lt;div /&gt;</span>
<span>), they will</span>
<span>not work in HTML5 because the</span>
<span>/</span>
<span>will be ignored, and you will</span>
<span>need to replace them with (for example)</span>
<span>&lt;div&gt;</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>. However,</span>
<span>you must still use the</span>
<span>&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span>form of HTML syntax when using</span>
<span>XHTML.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-1. Four simple Boolean expressions</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    echo "a: [" . (20 &gt; 9) . "]&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "b: [" . (5 == 6) . "]&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "c: [" . (1 == 0) . "]&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "d: [" . (1 == 1) . "]&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>The output from this code is as follows:</span>
<br/>
<b>a: [1]</b><br/>
<b>b: []</b><br/>
<b>c: []</b><br/>
<b>d: [1]</b><br/>
<span>Notice that both expressions</span>
<span>a:</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>d:</span>
<span>evaluate to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, which has a value of</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>. But</span>
<span>b:</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>c:</span>
<span>, which evaluate to</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, do not show any value, because in PHP the</span>
<span>constant</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>is defined as</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, or nothing. To verify this for yourself, you could</span>
<span>enter the code in</span>
<span>Example 4-2</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-2. Outputting the values of TRUE and FALSE</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php // test2.php
    echo "a: [" . TRUE . "]&lt;br&gt;";
    echo "b: [" . FALSE . "]&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>that outputs the following:</span>
<br/>
<b>a: [1]</b><br/>
<b>b: []</b><br/>
<span>By the way, in some languages</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>may be defined as</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>or even</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, so it&rsquo;s worth</span>
<span>checking on its definition in each language.</span>
<h4>Literals and Variables</h4>
<span>The simplest form of an expression is a</span>
<span>literal</span>
<span>, which simply means something that</span>
<span>evaluates to itself, such as the number</span>
<span>73</span>
<span>or the string</span>
<span>"Hello"</span>
<span>. An expression could</span>
<span>also simply be a variable, which evaluates to the value that has been assigned to it.</span>
<span>They are both types of expressions, because they return a value.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-3</span>
<span>shows three literals and two variables, all of which return values, albeit</span>
<span>of different types.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-3. Literals and variables</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $myname = "Brian";
    $myage = 37;
    
    echo "a: " . 73 . "&lt;br&gt;"; // Numeric literal
    echo "b: " . "Hello" . "&lt;br&gt;"; // String literal
    echo "c: " . FALSE . "&lt;br&gt;"; // Constant literal
    echo "d: " . $myname . "&lt;br&gt;"; // String variable
    echo "e: " . $myage . "&lt;br&gt;"; // Numeric variable
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>And, as you&rsquo;d expect, you see a return value from all of these with the exception of</span>
<span>c:</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>which evaluates to</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, returning nothing in the following output:</span>
<br/>
<b>a: 73</b><br/>
<b>b: Hello</b><br/>
<b>c:</b><br/>
<b>d: Brian</b><br/>
<b>e: 37</b><br/>
<span>In conjunction with operators, it&rsquo;s possible to create more-complex expressions that</span>
<span>evaluate to useful results.</span>
<br/>
<span>When you combine assignment or control-flow constructs with expressions, the</span>
<span>result is a</span>
<span>statement</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 4-4</span>
<span>shows one of each. The first assigns the result of the</span>
<span>expression</span>
<span>366 - $day_number</span>
<span>to the variable</span>
<span>$days_to_new_year</span>
<span>, and the second</span>
<span>outputs a friendly message only if the expression</span>
<span>$days_to_new_year &lt; 30</span>
<span>evaluates</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-4. An expression and a statement</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $days_to_new_year = 366 - $day_number; // Expression
    if ($days_to_new_year &lt; 30)
    {
        echo "Not long now till new year"; // Statement
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<span>PHP offers a lot of powerful operators that range from arithmetic, string, and logical</span>
<span>operators to assignment, comparison, and more (see</span>
<span>Table 4-1</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Table 4-1. PHP operator types</span>
<table class="tbl-left">
    <tr>
        <td>Operator</td>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Arithmetic</td>
        <td>Basic mathematics</td>
        <td>$a + $b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Array</td>
        <td>Array union</td>
        <td>$a + $b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Assignment</td>
        <td>Assign values</td>
        <td>$a = $b + 23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Bitwise</td>
        <td>Manipulate bits within bytes</td>
        <td>12 ^ 9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Comparison</td>
        <td>Compare two values</td>
        <td>$a &lt; $b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Execution</td>
        <td>Execute contents of back ticks</td>
        <td>`ls -al`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Increment/decrement</td>
        <td>Add or subtract 1</td>
        <td>$a++</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Logical</td>
        <td>Boolean</td>
        <td>$a and $b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>Concatenation</td>
        <td>$a . $b</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br/>
<span>Each operator takes a different number of operands:</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Unary</span>
<span>&nbsp;operators, such as incrementing (</span>
<span>$a++</span>
<span>) or negation (</span>
<span>-$a</span>
<span>), which take a</span>
<span>single operand.</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Binary</span>
<span>operators, which represent the bulk of PHP operators, including addition,</span>
<span>subtraction, multiplication, and division.</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>One</span>
<span>ternary</span>
<span>operator, which takes the form</span>
<span>? x : y</span>
<span>. It&rsquo;s a terse, single-line</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement that chooses between two expressions, depending on the result of a</span>
<span>third one.</span>
<h4>Operator Precedence</h4>
<span>If all operators had the same precedence, they would be processed in the order in</span>
<span>which they are encountered. In fact, many operators do have the same precedence, so</span>
<span>let&rsquo;s look at a few in</span>
<span>Example 4-5</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-5.</span>
<span>Three equivalent expressions</span>
<span>1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5</span><br/>
<span>2 - 4 + 5 + 3 + 1</span><br/>
<span>5 + 2 - 4 + 1 + 3</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>Here you will see that although the numbers (and their preceding operators) have</span>
<span>been moved, the result of each expression is the value</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>, because the plus and minus</span>
<span>operators have the same precedence. We can try the same thing with multiplication</span>
<span>and division (see</span>
<span>Example 4-6</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-6.</span>
<span>Three expressions that are also equivalent</span>
<br/>
<span>1 * 2 * 3 / 4 * 5</span><br/>
<span>2 / 4 * 5 * 3 * 1</span><br/>
<span>5 * 2 / 4 * 1 * 3</span><br/>
<span>Here the resulting value is always</span>
<span>7.5</span>
<span>. But things change when we mix operators with</span>
<span>different</span>
<span>precedencies in an expression, as in</span>
<span>Example 4-7</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-7.</span>
<span>Three expressions using operators of mixed precedence</span>
<br/>
<span>1 + 2 * 3 - 4 * 5</span><br/>
<span>2 - 4 * 5 * 3 + 1</span><br/>
<span>5 + 2 - 4 + 1 * 3</span><br/>
<span>If there were no operator precedence, these three expressions would evaluate to</span>
<span>25</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>29</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>, respectively. But because multiplication and division take precedence over</span>
<span>addition and subtraction, there are implied parentheses around these parts of the</span>
<span>expressions, which would look like</span>
<span>Example 4-8</span>
<span>if they were visible.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-8. Three expressions showing implied parentheses</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    1 + (2 * 3) - (4 * 5)
    2 - (4 * 5 * 3) + 1
    5 + 2 - 4 + (1 * 3)
</code>
</pre>
<span>Clearly, PHP must evaluate the subexpressions within parentheses first to derive the</span>
<span>semi-completed expressions in</span>
<span>Example 4-9</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-9. After evaluating the subexpressions in parentheses</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    1 + (6) - (20)
    2 - (60) + 1
    5 + 2 - 4 + (3)
</code>
</pre>
<span>The final results of these expressions are</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>13</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>57</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>, respectively (quite different</span>
<span>from the results of</span>
<span>25</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>29</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>that we would have seen had there been no opera‚Äê</span>
<span>tor precedence).</span>
<br/>
<span>Of course, you can override the default operator precedence by inserting your own</span>
<span>parentheses and forcing the original results that we would have seen had there been</span>
<span>no operator precedence (see</span>
<span>Example 4-10</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-10. Forcing</span>
<span>left-to-right evaluation</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    ((1 + 2) * 3 - 4) * 5
    (2 - 4) * 5 * 3 + 1
    (5 + 2 - 4 + 1) * 3
</code>
</pre>
<span>With parentheses correctly inserted, we now see the values</span>
<span>25</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>29</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>, respec‚Äê</span>
<span>tively.</span>

    </tr>

    </tr>
</table><br/>

<h4>Associativity</h4>
<span>We&rsquo;ve been looking at processing expressions from left to right, except where opera‚Äê</span>
<span>tor precedence is in effect. But some operators require processing from right to left,</span>
<span>and this direction of processing is called the operator&rsquo;s</span>
<span>associativity</span>
<span>. For some opera‚Äê</span>
<span>tors, there is no associativity.</span>
<br/>
<span>Associativity becomes important in cases in which you do not explicitly force prece‚Äê</span>
<span>dence, so you need to be aware of the default actions of operators, as detailed in</span>
<span>Table 4-3</span>
<span>, which lists operators and their associativity.</span>

<span>For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at the assignment operator in</span>
<span>Example 4-11</span>
<span>, where three</span>
<span>variables are all set to the value</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-11. A multiple-assignment statement</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $level = $score = $time = 0;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>This multiple assignment is possible only if the rightmost part of the expression is</span>
<span>evaluated first, and then processing continues in a right-to-left direction.</span>
<br/>
<span>As a beginner to PHP, you should avoid the potential pitfalls of</span>
<span>operator associativity by always nesting your subexpressions within</span>
<span>parentheses to force the order of evaluation. This will also help</span>
<span>other programmers who may have to maintain your code to under‚Äê</span>
<span>stand what is happening.</span>
<h4>Relational Operators</h4>
<span>Relational operators test two operands and return a Boolean result of either</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>. There are three types of relational operators:</span>
<span>equality</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>comparison</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>logical</span>
<span>.</span>
<h6>Equality</h6>
<span>As we&rsquo;ve already encountered a few times in this chapter, the equality operator is</span>
<span>==</span>
<span>(two equals signs). It is important not to confuse it with the</span>
<span>=</span>
<span>(single equals sign)</span>
<span>assignment operator. In</span>
<span>Example 4-12</span>
<span>, the first statement assigns a value and the sec‚Äê</span>
<span>ond tests it for equality.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-12. Assigning a value and testing for equality</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $month = "March";
    if ($month == "March") echo "It's springtime";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>As you see, by returning either</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, the equality operator enables you to</span>
<span>test for conditions using, for example, an</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement. But that&rsquo;s not the whole story,</span>
<span>because PHP is a loosely typed language. If the two operands of an equality expres‚Äê</span>
<span>sion are of different types, PHP will convert them to whatever type makes the best</span>
<span>sense to it.</span>
<br/>
<span>For example, any strings composed entirely of numbers will be converted to numbers</span>
<span>whenever compared with a number. In</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 4-13</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>are two different</span>
<span>strings, and we would therefore expect neither of the</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements to output a result.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-13.</span>
<span>The equality and identity operators</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $a = "1000";
    $b = "+1000";
    if ($a == $b) echo "1";
    if ($a === $b) echo "2";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>However, if you run the example, you will see that it outputs the number</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, which</span>
<span>means that the first</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement evaluated to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. This is because both strings were</span>
<span>first converted to numbers, and</span>
<span>1000</span>
<span>is the same numerical value as</span>
<span>+1000</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>In contrast, the second</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement uses the</span>
<span>identity</span>
<span>operator&mdash;three equals signs in</span>
<span>a row&mdash;which prevents PHP from automatically converting types.</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>therefore compared as strings and are found to be different, so nothing is output.</span>
<br/>
<span>As with forcing operator precedence, whenever you have any doubt about how PHP</span>
<span>will convert operand types, you can use the identity operator to turn this behavior off.</span>
<span>In the same way that you can use the equality operator to test for operands being</span>
<span>equal, you can test for them</span>
<span>not</span>
<span>being equal using</span>
<span>!=</span>
<span>, the inequality operator. Take a</span>
<span>look at</span>
<span>Example 4-14</span>
<span>, which is a rewrite of</span>
<span>Example 4-13</span>
<span>, in which the equality and</span>
<span>identity operators have been replaced with their inverses.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-14. The inequality and not-identical operators</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $a = "1000";
    $b = "+1000";
    if ($a != $b) echo "1";
    if ($a !== $b) echo "2";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>And, as you might expect, the first</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement does not output the number</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>because the code is asking whether</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>not</span>
<span>equal to each other numerically.</span>
<br/>
<span>Instead, it outputs the number</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>, because the second</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement is asking whether</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>&nbsp;not</span>
<span>&nbsp;identical to each other in their present operand types, and the</span>
<span>answer is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>; they are not the same.</span>
<h6>Comparison operators</h6>
<span>Using comparison operators, you can test for more than just equality and inequality.</span>
<span>PHP also gives you</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
<span>(is greater than),</span>
<span>&lt;</span>
<span>(is less than),</span>
<span>&gt;=</span>
<span>(is greater than or equal to),</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>&lt;=</span>
<span>(is less than or equal to) to play with.</span>
<span>Example 4-15</span>
<span>shows these in use.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-15.</span>
<span>The four comparison operators</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $a = 2; $b = 3;
    if ($a &gt; $b) echo "$a is greater than $b&lt;br&gt;";
    if ($a &lt; $b) echo "$a is less than $b&lt;br&gt;";
    if ($a &gt;= $b) echo "$a is greater than or equal to $b&lt;br&gt;";
    if ($a &lt;= $b) echo "$a is less than or equal to $b&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this example, where</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>, the following is output:</span>
<br/>
<b>2 is less than 3</b>
<br/>
<b>2 is less than or equal to 3</b>
<br/>
<span>Try this example yourself, altering the values of</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>, to see the results. Try set‚Äê</span>
<span>ting them to the same value and see what happens.</span>
<span>Logical operators</span>
<span>Logical operators produce true-or-false results, and therefore are also known as</span>
<span>Boolean operators</span>
<span>. There are four of them (see</span>
<span>Table 4-4</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Table 4-4. The logical operators</span>

<table class="tbl-left">
    <tr>
        <td>Logical operator</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AND</td>
        <td>TRUE if both operands are TRUE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>OR</td>
        <td>TRUE if either operand is TRUE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>XOR</td>
        <td>TRUE if one of the two operands is TRUE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>NOT</td>
        <td>TRUE if the operand is FALSE, or FALSE if the operand is TRUE</td>
    </tr>
</table><br/>

<span>You can see these operators used in</span>
<span>Example 4-16</span>
<span>. Note that the</span>
<span>!</span>
<span>symbol is required</span>
<span>by PHP in place of</span>
<span>NOT</span>
<span>. Furthermore, the operators can be lower- or uppercase.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-16.</span>
<span>The logical operators in use</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $a = 1; $b = 0;
    echo ($a AND $b) . "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo ($a or $b) . "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo ($a XOR $b) . "&lt;br&gt;";
    echo !$a . "&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>This example outputs</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, meaning that only the second and third</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>statements evaluate as</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. (Remember that</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>&mdash;</span>
<span>or nothing&mdash;represents a value</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>.) This is because the</span>
<span>AND</span>
<span>statement requires both operands to be</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>if it is</span>
<span>going to return a value of</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, while the fourth statement performs a</span>
<span>NOT</span>
<span>on the</span>
<span>value of</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>, turning it from</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>(a value of</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>) to</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>. If you wish to experiment</span>
<span>with this, try out the code, giving</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>varying values of</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>When coding, remember that</span>
<span>AND</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>OR</span>
<span>have lower precedence</span>
<span>than the other versions of the operators,</span>
<span>&amp;&amp;</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>||</span>
<span>. In complex</span>
<span>expressions, it may be safer to use</span>
<span>&amp;&amp;</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>||</span>
<span>for this reason.</span>
<br/>
<span>The</span>
<span>OR</span>
<span>operator can cause unintentional problems in</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements, because the sec‚Äê</span>
<span>ond operand will not be evaluated if the first is evaluated as</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. In</span>
<span>Example 4-17</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>the function</span>
<span>getnext</span>
<span>will never be called if</span>
<span>$finished</span>
<span>has a value of</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-17. A statement using the OR operator</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    if ($finished == 1 OR getnext() == 1) exit;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>If you need</span>
<span>getnext</span>
<span>to be called at each</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement, you could rewrite the code as</span>
<span>has been done in</span>
<span>Example 4-18</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-18.</span>
<span>The &ldquo;if...OR&rdquo; statement modified to ensure calling of getnext</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $gn = getnext();
    if ($finished == 1 OR $gn == 1) exit;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this case, the code in function</span>
<span>getnext</span>
<span>will be executed and the value returned</span>
<span>stored in</span>
<span>$gn</span>
<span>before the</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<br/>
<span>Another solution is to switch the two clauses to make sure that</span>
<span>get</span>
<span>next</span>
<span>is executed, as it will then appear first in the expression.</span>
<br/>
<span>Table 4-5</span>
<span>shows all the possible variations of using the logical operators. You should</span>
<span>also note that</span>
<span>!TRUE</span>
<span>equals</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, and</span>
<span>!FALSE</span>
<span>equals</span>
<span>TRUE</span>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<span>Conditionals</span>
<span>&nbsp;alter program flow. They enable you to ask questions about certain</span>
<span>things and respond to the answers you get in different ways. Conditionals are central</span>
<span>to dynamic web pages&mdash;the goal of using PHP in the first place&mdash;because they make</span>
<span>it easy to create different output each time a page is viewed.</span>
<br/>
<span>There are three types of nonlooping conditionals: the</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement, the</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>state‚Äê</span>
<span>ment, and the</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>operator. By</span>
<span>nonlooping</span>
<span>, I mean that the actions initiated by the state‚Äê</span>
<span>ment take place and program flow then moves on, whereas looping conditionals</span>
<span>(which we&rsquo;ll get to shortly) execute code over and over until a condition is met.</span>
<h4>The if Statement</h4>
<span>One way of thinking about program flow is to imagine it as a single-lane highway that</span>
<span>you</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>driving</span>
<span>along.</span>
<span>It&rsquo;s</span>
<span>pretty</span>
<span>much</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>straight</span>
<span>line,</span>
<span>but</span>
<span>now</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>then</span>
<span>you</span>
<span>encounter various signs telling you where to go.</span>
<br/>
<span>In the case of an</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement, you could imagine coming across a detour sign that</span>
<span>you have to follow if a certain condition is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. If so, you drive off and follow the</span>
<span>detour until you return to where it started and then continue on your way in your</span>
<span>original direction. Or, if the condition isn&rsquo;t</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, you ignore the detour and carry on</span>
<span>driving (see</span>
<span>Figure 4-1</span>
<span>).</span>
<p><image src="images/4.1.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 4-1. Program flow is like a single-lane highway</span>
<br/>
<span>The contents of the</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>condition can be any valid PHP expression, including equality,</span>
<span>comparison, tests for</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>NULL</span>
<span>, and even the values returned by functions (either</span>
<span>built-in functions or ones that you write).</span>
<br/>
<span>The actions to take when an</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>condition is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>are generally placed inside curly</span>
<span>braces,</span>
<span>{ }</span>
<span>. However, you can ignore the braces if you have only a single statement to</span>
<span>execute. But if you always use curly braces, you&rsquo;ll avoid having to hunt down difficult-</span>
<span>to-trace bugs, such as when you add an extra line to a condition and it doesn&rsquo;t get</span>
<span>evaluated due to lack of braces. (Note that for space and clarity, many of the examples</span>
<span>in this book ignore this suggestion and omit the braces for single statements.)</span>
<br/>
<span>In</span>
<span>Example 4-19</span>
<span>, imagine that it is the end of the month and all your bills have been</span>
<span>paid, so you are performing some bank account maintenance.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-19. An if statement with curly braces</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    if ($bank_balance &lt; 100)
    {
        $money = 1000;
        $bank_balance += $money;
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this example, you are checking your balance to see whether it is less than 100 dol‚Äê</span>
<span>lars (or whatever your currency is). If so, you pay yourself 1,000 dollars and then add</span>
<span>it to the balance. (If only making money were that simple!)</span>
<br/>
<span>If the bank balance is 100 dollars or greater, the conditional statements are ignored</span>
<span>and program flow skips to the next line (not shown).</span>
<br/>
<span>In this book, opening curly braces generally start on a new line. Some people like to</span>
<span>place the first curly brace to the right of the conditional expression; others start a new</span>
<span>line with it. Either of these is fine, because PHP allows you to set out your whitespace</span>
<span>characters (spaces, newlines, and tabs) any way you choose. However, you will find</span>
<span>your code easier to read and debug if you indent each level of conditionals with a tab.</span>
<h4>The else Statement</h4>
<span>Sometimes when a conditional is not</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, you may not want to continue on to the</span>
<span>main program code immediately but might wish to do something else instead. This is</span>
<span>where the</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>statement comes in. With it, you can set up a second detour on your</span>
<span>highway, as in</span>
<span>Figure 4-2</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>With an</span>
<span>if...else</span>
<span>statement, the first conditional statement is executed if the condi‚Äê</span>
<span>tion is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. But if it&rsquo;s</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>, the second one is executed. One of the two choices</span>
<span>must</span>
<span>be executed. Under no circumstance can both (or neither) be executed.</span>
<span>Example 4-20</span>
<span>shows the use of the</span>
<span>if...else</span>
<span>structure.</span>
<p><img src="images/4.2.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 4-2. The highway now has an if detour and an else detour</span>
<span>Example 4-20. An if...else statement with curly braces</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    if ($bank_balance &lt; 100)
    {
        $money = 1000;
        $bank_balance += $money;
    }
    else
    {
        $savings += 50;
        $bank_balance -= 50;
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this example, now that you&rsquo;ve ascertained that you have $100 or more in the bank,</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>statement is executed, by which you place some of this money into your sav‚Äê</span>
<span>ings account.</span>
<br/>
<span>As with</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements, if your</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>has only one conditional statement, you can opt</span>
<span>to leave out the curly braces. (Curly braces are always recommended, though. First,</span>
<span>they make the code easier to understand. Second, they let you easily add more state‚Äê</span>
<span>ments to the branch later.)</span>
<h4>The elseif Statement</h4>
<span>There are also times when you want a number of different possibilities to occur, based</span>
<span>upon a sequence of conditions. You can achieve this using the</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>statement. As</span>
<span>you might imagine, it is like an</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>statement, except that you place a further condi‚Äê</span>
<span>tional expression prior to the conditional code. In</span>
<span>Example 4-21</span>
<span>, you can see a com‚Äê</span>
<span>plete</span>
<span>if...elseif...else</span>
<span>construct.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-21. An if...elseif...else statement with curly braces</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    if ($bank_balance &lt; 100)
    {
        $money = 1000;
        $bank_balance += $money;
    }
    elseif ($bank_balance &gt; 200)
    {
        $savings += 100;
        $bank_balance -= 100;
    }
    else
    {
        $savings += 50;
        $bank_balance -= 50;
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>


<span>In the example, an</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>statement has been inserted between the</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>state‚Äê</span>
<span>ments. It checks whether your bank balance exceeds $200 and, if so, decides that you</span>
<span>can afford to save $100 of it this month.</span>
<br/>
<span>Although I&rsquo;m starting to stretch the metaphor a bit too far, you can imagine this as a</span>
<span>multiway set of detours (see</span>
<span>Figure 4-3</span>
<span>).</span>
<p><img src="images/4.3.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 4-3. The highway with if, elseif, and else detours</span>
<span>An</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>statement</span>
<span>closes</span>
<span>either</span>
<span>an</span>
<span>if...else</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>an</span>
<span>if...elseif...else</span>
<span>statement. You can leave out a final</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>if it</span>
<span>is not required, but you cannot have one before an</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>; neither</span>
<span>can you have an</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>before an</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<span>You may have as many</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>statements as you like. But as the number of</span>
<span>elseif</span>
<span>statements increases, you would probably be better advised to consider a</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement if it fits your needs. We&rsquo;ll look at that next.</span>
<h4>The switch Statement</h4>
<span>The</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement is useful in cases in which one variable or the result of an</span>
<span>expression can have multiple values, which should each trigger a different function.</span>
<br/>
<span>For example, consider a PHP-driven menu system that passes a single string to the</span>
<span>main menu code according to what the user requests. Let&rsquo;s say the options are Home,</span>
<span>About, News, Login, and Links, and we set the variable</span>
<span>$page</span>
<span>to one of these, accord‚Äê</span>
<span>ing to the user&rsquo;s input.</span>
<br/>
<span>If</span>
<span>we</span>
<span>write</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>code</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>this</span>
<span>using</span>
<span>if...elseif...else</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>it</span>
<span>might</span>
<span>look</span>
<span>like</span>
<span>Example 4-22</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-22. A multiple-line if...elseif...statement</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    if ($page == "Home") echo "You selected Home";
    elseif ($page == "About") echo "You selected About";
    elseif ($page == "News") echo "You selected News";
    elseif ($page == "Login") echo "You selected Login";
    elseif ($page == "Links") echo "You selected Links";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>If we use a</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement, the code might look like</span>
<span>Example 4-23</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-23. A switch statement</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    switch ($page)
    {
        case "Home":
            echo "You selected Home";
            break;
        case "About":
            echo "You selected About";
            break;
        case "News":
            echo "You selected News";
            break;
        case "Login":
            echo "You selected Login";
            break;
        case "Links":
            echo "You selected Links";
            break;
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>As you can see,</span>
<span>$page</span>
<span>is mentioned only once at the start of the</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<span>Thereafter, the</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>command checks for matches. When one occurs, the matching</span>
<span>conditional statement is executed. Of course, in a real program you would have code</span>
<span>here to display or jump to a page, rather than simply telling the user what was</span>
<span>selected.</span>
<br/>
<span>With</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statements, you do not use curly braces inside</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>commands. Instead, they commence with a colon and end with</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>statement. The entire list of cases in the</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>state‚Äê</span>
<span>ment is enclosed in a set of curly braces, though.</span>
<br/>
<h6>Breaking out</h6>
<span>If you wish to break out of the</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement because a condition has been fulfil‚Äê</span>
<span>led, use the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command. This command tells PHP to break out of the</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>and jump to the following statement.</span>
<br/>
<span>If you were to leave out the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>commands in</span>
<span>Example 4-23</span>
<span>and the</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>Home</span>
<span>evaluated to be</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, all five cases would then be executed. Or if</span>
<span>$page</span>
<span>had the value</span>
<span>News</span>
<span>, all the</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>commands from then on would execute. This is deliberate and</span>
<span>allows for some advanced programming, but generally you should always remember</span>
<span>to issue a</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command every time a set of</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>conditionals has finished execut‚Äê</span>
<span>ing. In fact, leaving out the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>statement is a common error.</span>
<h6>Default action</h6>
<span>A typical requirement in</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statements is to fall back on a default action if none</span>
<span>of the</span>
<span>case</span>
<span>conditions are met. For example, in the case of the menu code in</span>
<span>Example 4-23</span>
<span>, you could add the code in</span>
<span>Example 4-24</span>
<span>immediately before the final</span>
<span>curly brace.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-24. A default statement to add to</span>
<span>Example 4-23</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    default:
        echo "Unrecognized selection";
        break;
</code>
</pre>

<span>Although a</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command is not required here because the default is the final sub-</span>
<span>statement, and program flow will automatically continue to the closing curly brace,</span>
<span>should you decide to place the</span>
<span>default</span>
<span>statement higher up, it would definitely need</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command to prevent program flow from dropping into the following state‚Äê</span>
<span>ments. Generally, the safest practice is to always include the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command.</span>
<h6>Alternative syntax</h6>
<span>If you prefer, you may replace the first curly brace in a</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement with a single</span>
<span>colon, and the final curly brace with an</span>
<span>endswitch</span>
<span>command, as in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 4-25</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>However, this approach is not commonly used and is mentioned here only in case</span>
<span>you encounter it in third-party code.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-25. Alternate switch statement syntax</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    switch ($page):
        case "Home":
            echo "You selected Home";
            break;
            // etc...
        case "Links":
            echo "You selected Links";
        break;
    endswitch;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h4>The ? Operator</h4>
<span>One way of avoiding the verbosity of</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>else</span>
<span>statements is to use the more com‚Äê</span>
<span>pact ternary operator,</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>, which is unusual in that it takes three operands rather than</span>
<span>the typical two.</span>
<br/>
<span>We briefly came across this in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Chapter 3</span>
<span>&nbsp;in the discussion about the difference</span>
<span>between the</span>
<span>print</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>statements as an example of an operator type that works</span>
<span>well with</span>
<span>print</span>
<span>but not</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>The</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>operator is passed an expression that it must evaluate, along with two state‚Äê</span>
<span>ments to execute: one for when the expression evaluates to</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>, the other for when it</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 4-26</span>
<span>shows code we might use for writing a warning about the fuel</span>
<span>level of a car to its digital dashboard.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-26. Using the ? operator</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    echo $fuel &lt;= 1 ? "Fill tank now" : "There's enough fuel";
    ?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<span>In this statement, if there is one gallon or less of fuel (in other words,</span>
<span>$fuel</span>
<span>is set to</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>or less), the string</span>
<span>Fill tank now</span>
<span>is returned to the preceding</span>
<span>echo</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<span>Otherwise, the string</span>
<span>There's enough fuel</span>
<span>is returned. You can also assign the value</span>
<span>returned in a</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>statement to a variable (see</span>
<span>Example 4-27</span>
<span>).</span>
<span>Example 4-27. Assigning a ? conditional result to a variable</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $enough = $fuel &lt;= 1 ? FALSE : TRUE;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<span>Here</span>
<span>$enough</span>
<span>will be assigned the value</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>only when there is more than a gallon</span>
<span>of fuel; otherwise, it is assigned the value</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>If you find the</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>operator confusing, you are free to stick to</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements, but you</span>
<span>should be familiar with it, because you&rsquo;ll see it in other people&rsquo;s code. It can be hard to</span>
<span>read, because it often mixes multiple occurrences of the same variable. For instance,</span>
<span>code such as the following is quite popular:</span>
<br/>
<span>$saved = $saved &gt;= $new ? $saved : $new;</span>
<br/>
<span>If you take it apart carefully, you can figure out what this code does:</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    $saved =                // Set the value of $saved to...
        $saved &gt;= $new   // Check $saved against $new
      ?                     // Yes, comparison is true
        $saved              // ... so assign the current value of $saved
      :                     // No, comparison is false
        $new;               // ... so assign the value of $new
</code>
</pre>

<span>It&rsquo;s a concise way to keep track of the largest value that you&rsquo;ve seen as a program pro‚Äê</span>
<span>gresses. You save the largest value in</span>
<span>$saved</span>
<span>and compare it to</span>
<span>$new</span>
<span>each time you get</span>
<span>a new value. Programmers familiar with the</span>
<span>?</span>
<span>operator find it more convenient than</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements for such short comparisons. When not used for writing compact code,</span>
<span>it is typically used to make some decision inline, such as when you are testing</span>
<span>whether a variable is set before passing it to a function.</span>
<h3>Looping</h3>
<span>One of the great things about computers is that they can repeat calculating tasks</span>
<span>quickly and tirelessly. Often you may want a program to repeat the same sequence of</span>
<span>code again and again until something happens, such as a user inputting a value or</span>
<span>reaching a natural end. PHP&rsquo;s loop structures provide the perfect way to do this.</span>
<br/>
<span>To picture how this works, look at</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 4-4</span>
<span>. It is much the same as the highway</span>
<span>metaphor used to illustrate</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements, except the detour also has a loop section</span>
<span>that&mdash;once</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>vehicle</span>
<span>has</span>
<span>entered&mdash;can</span>
<span>be</span>
<span>exited</span>
<span>only</span>
<span>under</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>right</span>
<span>program</span>
<span>conditions.</span>
<br/>
<p><img src="images/4.4.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 4-4. Imagining a loop as part of a program highway layout</span>
<h4>while Loops</h4>
<span>Let&rsquo;s turn the digital car dashboard in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 4-26</span>
<span>&nbsp;into a loop that continuously</span>
<span>checks the fuel level as you drive, using a</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop (</span>
<span>Example 4-28</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-28. A while loop</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    $fuel = 10;
    while ($fuel &gt; 1)
    {
        // Keep driving ...
        echo "There's enough fuel";
    }
    ?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<span>Actually, you might prefer to keep a green light lit rather than output text, but the</span>
<span>point is that whatever positive indication you wish to make about the level of fuel is</span>
<span>placed inside the</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop. By the way, if you try this example for yourself, note</span>
<span>that it will keep printing the string until you click the Stop button in your browser.</span>
<br/>
<span>As</span>
<span>with</span>
<span>if</span>
<span>statements,</span>
<span>you</span>
<span>will</span>
<span>notice</span>
<span>that</span>
<span>curly</span>
<span>braces</span>
<span>are</span>
<span>required to hold the statements inside the</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>statements, unless</span>
<span>there&rsquo;s only one.</span>
<br/>
<span>For</span>
<span>another</span>
<span>example</span>
<span>of</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop</span>
<span>that</span>
<span>displays</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>times</span>
<span>table,</span>
<span>see</span>
<span>Example 4-29</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-29. A while loop to print the 12 times table</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    $count = 1;
    while ($count &lt;= 12)
    {
        echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "&lt;br&gt;";
        ++$count;
    }
    ?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Here the variable</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>is initialized to a value of 1, and then a</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop is started</span>
<span>with the comparative expression</span>
<span>$count &lt;= 12</span>
<span>. This loop will continue executing</span>
<span>until the variable is greater than 12. The output from this code is as follows:</span>
<br/>
<b>1 times 12 is 12</b>
<br/>
<b>2 times 12 is 24</b>
<br/>
<b>3 times 12 is 36</b>
<br/>
<span>and so on...</span>
<br/>
<span>Inside the loop, a string is printed along with the value of</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>multiplied by 12.</span>
<span>For neatness, this is followed with a</span>
<span>&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>tag to force a new line. Then</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>incremented, ready for the final curly brace that tells PHP to return to the start of the</span>
<span>loop.</span>
<br/>
<span>At this point,</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>is again tested to see whether it is greater than 12. It isn&rsquo;t, but it</span>
<span>now has the value</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>, and after another 11 times around the loop, it will have the value</span>
<span>13</span>
<span>. When that happens, the code within the</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop is skipped and execution</span>
<span>passes to the code following the loop, which, in this case, is the end of the program.</span>
<br/>
<span>If the</span>
<span>++$count</span>
<span>statement (which could equally have been</span>
<span>$count++</span>
<span>) had not been</span>
<span>there, this loop would be like the first one in this section. It would never end, and</span>
<span>only the result of</span>
<span>1 * 12</span>
<span>would be printed over and over.</span>
<br/>
<span>But there is a much neater way this loop can be written, which I think you will like.</span>
<span>Take a look at</span>
<span>Example 4-30</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-30. A shortened version of</span>
<span>Example 4-29</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    &lt;?php
        $count = 0;
        while (++$count &lt;= 12)
            echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "&lt;br&gt;";
    ?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>In this example, it was possible to remove the</span>
<span>++$count</span>
<span>statement from inside the</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop and place it directly into the conditional expression of the loop. What</span>
<span>now happens is that PHP encounters the variable</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>at the start of each iteration</span>
<span>of the loop and, noticing that it is prefaced with the increment operator, first incre‚Äê</span>
<span>ments the variable and only then compares it to the value</span>
<span>12</span>
<span>. You can therefore see</span>
<span>that</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>now has to be initialized to</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>, not</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, because it is incremented as soon as</span>
<span>the loop is entered. If you keep the initialization at</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, only results between 2 and 12</span>
<span>will be output.</span>
<h4>do...while Loops</h4>
<span>A slight variation to the</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loop is the</span>
<span>do...while</span>
<span>loop, used when you want a</span>
<span>block of code to be executed at least once and made conditional only after that.</span>
<span>Example 4-31</span>
<span>shows a modified version of the code for the 12 times table that uses</span>
<span>such a loop.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-31. A do...while loop for printing the times table for 12</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $count = 1;
    do
        echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "&lt;br&gt;";
    while (++$count &lt;= 12);
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Notice how we are back to initializing</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>(rather than</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>) because the code is</span>
<span>being executed immediately, without an opportunity to increment the variable. Other</span>
<span>than that, though, the code looks pretty similar.</span>
<br/>
<span>Of course, if you have more than a single statement inside a</span>
<span>do...while</span>
<span>loop,</span>
<span>remember to use curly braces, as in</span>
<span>Example 4-32</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-32. Expanding</span>
<span>Example 4-31</span>
<span>to use curly braces</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $count = 1;
    do {
        echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12;
        echo "&lt;br&gt;";
    } while (++$count &lt;= 12);
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<h4>for Loops</h4>
<span>The final kind of loop statement, the</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop, is also the most powerful, as it com‚Äê</span>
<span>bines the abilities to set up variables as you enter the loop, test for conditions while</span>
<span>iterating loops, and modify variables after each iteration.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-33</span>
<span>shows how to write the multiplication table program with a</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-33. Outputting the times table for 12 from a for loop</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    for ($count = 1 ; $count &lt;= 12 ; ++$count)
        echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12 . "&lt;br&gt;";
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>See how the code has been reduced to a single</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statement containing a single con‚Äê</span>
<span>ditional statement? Here&rsquo;s what is going on. Each</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statement takes three parame‚Äê</span>
<span>ters:</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>An initialization expression</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A condition expression</span>
<br/>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>A modification expression</span>
<br/>
<span>These are separated by semicolons like this:</span>
<span>for (</span>
<span>expr1</span>
<span>;</span>
<span>expr2</span>
<span>;</span>
<span>expr3</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>. At the</span>
<span>start of the first iteration of the loop, the initialization expression is executed. In the</span>
<span>case of the times table code,</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>is initialized to the value</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>. Then, each time</span>
<span>around the loop, the condition expression (in this case,</span>
<span>$count &lt;= 12</span>
<span>) is tested, and</span>
<span>the loop is entered only if the condition is</span>
<span>TRUE</span>
<span>. Finally, at the end of each iteration,</span>
<span>the modification expression is executed. In the case of the times table code, the vari‚Äê</span>
<span>able</span>
<span>$count</span>
<span>is incremented.</span>
<br/>
<span>All this structure neatly removes any requirement to place the controls for a loop</span>
<span>within its body, freeing it up just for the statements you want the loop to perform.</span>
<br/>
<span>Remember to use curly braces with a</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop if it will contain more than one state‚Äê</span>
<span>ment, as in</span>
<span>Example 4-34</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-34.</span>
<span>The for loop from</span>
<span>Example 4-33</span>
<span>with added curly braces</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    for ($count = 1 ; $count &lt;= 12 ; ++$count)
    {
        echo "$count times 12 is " . $count * 12;
        echo "&lt;br&gt;";
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>Let&rsquo;s compare when to use</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>loops. The</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop is explicitly designed</span>
<span>around a single value that changes on a regular basis. Usually you have a value that</span>
<span>increments, as when you are passed a list of user choices and want to process each</span>
<span>choice in turn. But you can transform the variable any way you like. A more complex</span>
<span>form of the</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statement even lets you perform multiple operations in each of the</span>
<span>three parameters:</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    for ($i = 1, $j = 1 ; $i + $j &lt; 10 ; $i++ , $j++)
    {
        // ...
    }
</code>
</pre>
<span>That&rsquo;s complicated and not recommended for first-time users. The key is to distin‚Äê</span>
<span>guish commas from semicolons. The three parameters must be separated by semico</span>
<span>lons. Within each parameter, multiple statements can be separated by commas. Thus,</span>
<span>in the previous example, the first and third parameters each contain two statements:</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
    $i = 1, $j = 1 // Initialize $i and $j
    $i + $j &lt; 10 // Terminating condition
    $i++ , $j++ // Modify $i and $j at the end of each iteration
</code>
</pre>

<span>The main thing to take from this example is that you must separate the three parame‚Äê</span>
<span>ter sections with semicolons, not commas (which should be used only to separate</span>
<span>statements within a parameter section).</span>
<br/>
<span>So, when is a</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>statement more appropriate than a</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>statement? When your</span>
<span>condition doesn&rsquo;t depend on a simple, regular change to a variable. For instance, if</span>
<span>you want to check for some special input or error and end the loop when it occurs,</span>
<span>use a</span>
<span>while</span>
<span>statement.</span>
<h4>Breaking Out of a Loop</h4>
<span>Just as you saw how to break out of a</span>
<span>switch</span>
<span>statement, you can also break out of a</span>
<span>for</span>
<span>loop using the same</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command. This step can be necessary when, for</span>
<span>example, one of your statements returns an error and the loop cannot continue exe‚Äê</span>
<span>cuting safely.</span>
<br/>
<span>One case in which this might occur is when writing a file returns an error, possibly</span>
<span>because the disk is full (see</span>
<span>Example 4-35</span>
<span>).</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-35. Writing a</span>
<span>file using a for loop with error trapping</span>

<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $fp = fopen("text.txt", 'wb');
    for ($j = 0 ; $j &lt; 100 ; ++$j)
    {
        $written = fwrite($fp, "data");
        
        if ($written == FALSE) break;
    }
    fclose($fp);
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<span>This is the most complicated piece of code that you have seen so far, but you&rsquo;re ready</span>
<span>for it. We&rsquo;ll look into the file-handling commands in a later chapter, but for now all</span>
<span>you need to know is that the first line opens the file</span>
<span>&nbsp;text.txt</span>
<span>&nbsp;for writing in binary</span>
<span>mode, and then returns a pointer to the file in the variable</span>
<span>$fp</span>
<span>, which is used later to</span>
<span>refer to the open file.</span>
<br/>
<span>The loop then iterates 100 times (from 0 to 99), writing the string</span>
<span>data</span>
<span>to the file.</span>
<span>After each write, the variable</span>
<span>$written</span>
<span>is assigned a value by the</span>
<span>fwrite</span>
<span>function</span>
<span>representing the number of characters correctly written. But if there is an error, the</span>
<span>fwrite</span>
<span>function assigns the value</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>The behavior of</span>
<span>fwrite</span>
<span>makes it easy for the code to check the variable</span>
<span>$written</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>see whether it is set to</span>
<span>FALSE</span>
<span>and, if so, to break out of the loop to the following state‚Äê</span>
<span>ment closing the file.</span>
<br/>
<span>If you are looking to improve the code, the line</span>
<pre><code class="php">if ($written == FALSE) break;</code></pre>
<span>can be simplified using the</span>
<span>NOT</span>
<span>operator, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="php">if (!$written) break;</code></pre>
<span>In fact, the pair of inner loop statements can be shortened to a single statement:</span>
<pre><code class="php">if (!fwrite($fp, "data")) break;</code></pre>
<span>The</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command is even more powerful than you might think, because if you</span>
<span>have code nested more than one layer deep that you need to break out of, you can</span>
<span>follow the</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>command with a number to indicate how many levels to break out</span>
<span>of:</span>
<pre><code class="php">break 2;</code></pre>
<h4>The continue Statement</h4>
<span>The</span>
<span>continue</span>
<span>statement is a little like a</span>
<span>break</span>
<span>statement, except that it instructs PHP</span>
<span>to stop processing the current loop and to move right to its next iteration. So, instead</span>
<span>of breaking out of the whole loop, PHP exits only the current iteration.</span>
<br/>
<span>This approach can be useful in cases where you know there is no point continuing</span>
<span>execution within the current loop and you want to save processor cycles or prevent</span>
<span>an error from occurring by moving right along to the next iteration of the loop. In</span>
<span>Example 4-36</span>
<span>, a</span>
<span>continue</span>
<span>statement is used to prevent a division-by-zero error from</span>
<span>being issued when the variable</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>has a value of</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-36. Trapping division-by-zero errors using continue</span>
<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $j = 10;
    while ($j &gt; -10)
    {
        $j--;
        
        if ($j == 0) continue;
        
        echo (10 / $j) . "&lt;br&gt;";
    }
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<span>For all values of</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>between</span>
<span>10</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>&ndash;</span>
<span>10</span>
<span>, with the exception of</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>, the result of calculat‚Äê</span>
<span>ing</span>
<span>10</span>
<span>divided by</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>is displayed. But for the case of</span>
<span>$j</span>
<span>being</span>
<span>0</span>
<span>, the statement</span>
<span>con</span>
<span>tinue</span>
<span>is issued and execution skips immediately to the next iteration of the loop.</span>
<h3>Implicit and Explicit Casting</h3>
<span>PHP is a loosely typed language that allows you to declare a variable and its type sim‚Äê</span>
<span>ply by using it. It also automatically converts values from one type to another when‚Äê</span>
<span>ever required. This is called</span>
<span>implicit casting</span>
<span>.</span>
<br/>
<span>However, at times PHP&rsquo;s implicit casting may not be what you want. In</span>
<span>Example 4-37</span>
<span>,</span>
<span>note that the inputs to the division are integers. By default, PHP converts the output</span>
<span>to floating point so it can give the most precise value&mdash;4.66 recurring.</span>
<br/>
<span>Example 4-37.</span>
<span>This expression returns a floating-point number</span>

<pre>
<code class="php">
&lt;?php
    $a = 56;
    $b = 12;
    $c = $a / $b;
    
    echo $c;
?&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<span>But what if we had wanted</span>
<span>$c</span>
<span>to be an integer instead? There are various ways in</span>
<span>which we could achieve this, one of which is to force the result of</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>/</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>to be cast to</span>
<span>an integer value using the integer cast type</span>
<span>(int)</span>
<span>, like this:</span>
<pre><code class="php">$c = (int) ($a / $b);</code></pre>
<span>This is called</span>
<span>explicit</span>
<span>casting. Note that in order to ensure that the value of the entire</span>
<span>expression</span>
<span>is</span>
<span>cast</span>
<span>to</span>
<span>an</span>
<span>integer,</span>
<span>we</span>
<span>place</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>expression</span>
<span>within</span>
<span>parentheses.</span>
<span>Otherwise, only the variable</span>
<span>$a</span>
<span>would have been cast to an integer&mdash;a pointless exer‚Äê</span>
<span>cise, as the division by</span>
<span>$b</span>
<span>would still have returned a floating-point number.</span>
<br/>
<span>You can explicitly cast to the types shown in</span>
<span>Table 4-6</span>
<span>, but you can</span>
<span>usually avoid having to use a cast by calling one of PHP&rsquo;s built-in</span>
<span>functions. For example, to obtain an integer value, you could use</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>intval</span>
<span>function. As with some other sections in this book, this</span>
<span>one is mainly here to help you understand third-party code that</span>
<span>you may encounter.</span>
<br/>

<br/>

    <tr>
        <td>Cast type</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(int) (integer)</td>
        <td>Cast to an integer by dropping the decimal portion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(bool) (boolean)</td>
        <td>Cast to a Boolean</td>
    </tr>

        <td>(float) (double) (real)</td>
        <td>Cast to a floating-point number</td>
    </tr>

        <td>(string)</td>
        <td>Cast to a string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(array)</td>
        <td>Cast to an array</td>
    </tr>

<h3>PHP Dynamic Linking</h3>
<span>Because PHP is a programming language, and the output from it can be completely</span>
<span>different for each user, it&rsquo;s possible for an entire website to run from a single PHP web</span>
<span>page. Each time the user clicks on something, the details can be sent back to the same</span>
<span>web page, which decides what to do next according to the various cookies and/or</span>
<span>other session details it may have stored.</span>
<br/>
<span>But although it is possible to build an entire website this way, it&rsquo;s not recommended,</span>
<span>because your source code will grow and grow and start to become unwieldy, as it has</span>
<span>to account for every possible action a user could take.</span>
<br/>
<span>Instead, it&rsquo;s much more sensible to split your website development into different</span>
<span>parts. For example, one distinct process is signing up for a website, along with all the</span>
<span>checking this entails to validate an email address, determine whether a username is</span>
<span>already taken, and so on.</span>
<br/>
<span>A second module might well be one for logging users in before handing them off to</span>
<span>the main part of your website. Then you might have a messaging module with the</span>
<span>facility for users to leave comments, a module containing links and useful informa‚Äê</span>
<span>tion, another to allow uploading of images, and more.</span>
<br/>
<span>As long as you have created a way to track your user through your website by means</span>
<span>of cookies or session variables (both of which we&rsquo;ll look at more closely in later</span>
<span>chapters), you can split up your website into sensible sections of PHP code, each one</span>
<span>self-contained, and therefore treat yourself to a much easier future, developing each</span>
<span>new feature and maintaining old ones.</span>
<h3>Dynamic Linking in Action</h3>
<span>One of the more popular PHP-driven applications on the Web today is the blogging</span>
<span>platform WordPress (see</span>
<span>&nbsp;Figure 4-5</span>
<span>). As a blogger or a blog reader, you might not</span>
<span>realize it, but every major section has been given its own main PHP file, and a whole</span>
<span>raft of generic, shared functions have been placed in separate files that are included</span>
<span>by the main PHP pages as necessary.</span>
<p><img src="images/4.5.png"/></p>
<span>Figure 4-5. The WordPress blogging platform is written in PHP</span>
<br/>
<span>The whole platform is held together with behind-the-scenes session tracking, so that</span>
<span>you hardly know when you are transitioning from one subsection to another. So, as a</span>
<span>web developer, if you want to tweak WordPress, it&rsquo;s easy to find the particular file you</span>
<span>need, modify it, and test and debug it without messing around with unconnected</span>
<span>parts of the program. Next time you use WordPress, keep an eye on your browser&rsquo;s</span>
<span>address bar, particularly if you are managing a blog, and you&rsquo;ll notice some of the dif‚Äê</span>
<span>ferent PHP files that it uses.</span>
<br/>
<span>This chapter has covered quite a lot of ground, and by now you should be able to put</span>
<span>together your own small PHP programs. But before you do, and before proceeding</span>
<span>with the following chapter on functions and objects, you may wish to test your new</span>
<span>knowledge on the following questions.</span>
