    <h2>Introduction to Dynamic Web Content</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web is a constantly evolving network that has already traveled far</p>
    <p>beyond its conception in the early 1990s, when it was created to solve a specific prob‐</p>
    <p>lem. State-of-the-art experiments at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle</p>
    <p>Physics&mdash;now best known as the operator of the Large Hadron Collider) were pro‐</p>
    <p>ducing incredible amounts of data&mdash;so much that the data was proving unwieldy to</p>
    <p>distribute to the participating scientists who were spread out across the world.</p>
    <p>At this time, the Internet was already in place, with several hundred thousand com‐</p>
    <p>puters connected to it, so Tim Berners-Lee (a CERN fellow) devised a method of nav‐</p>
    <p>igating between them using a hyperlinking framework, which came to be known as</p>
    <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. He also created a markup language called</p>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. To bring these together, he wrote the first</p>
    <p>web browser and web server, tools that we now take for granted.</p>
    <p>But back then, the concept was revolutionary. The most connectivity so far experi‐</p>
    <p>enced by at-home modem users was dialing up and connecting to a bulletin board</p>
    <p>that was hosted by a single computer, where you could communicate and swap data</p>
    <p>only with other users of that service. Consequently, you needed to be a member of</p>
    <p>many bulletin board systems in order to effectively communicate electronically with</p>
    <p>your colleagues and friends.</p>
    <p>But Berners-Lee changed all that in one fell swoop, and by the mid-1990s, there were</p>
    <p>three major graphical web browsers competing for the attention of 5 million users. It</p>
    <p>soon became obvious, though, that something was missing. Yes, pages of text and</p>
    <p>graphics with hyperlinks to take you to other pages was a brilliant concept, but the</p>
    <p>results didn&rsquo;t reflect the instantaneous potential of computers and the Internet to</p>
    <p>meet the particular needs of each user with dynamically changing content. Using the</p>
    <p>Web was a very dry and plain experience, even if we did now have scrolling text and</p>
    <p>animated GIFs!</p>
    <p>Shopping carts, search engines, and social networks have clearly altered how we use</p>
    <p>the Web. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll take a brief look at the various components that make</p>
    <p>up the Web, and the software that helps make it a rich and dynamic experience.</p>
    <p>It is necessary to start using some acronyms more or less right</p>
    <p>away. I have tried to clearly explain them before proceeding. But</p>
    <p>don&rsquo;t worry too much about what they stand for or what these</p>
    <p>names mean, because the details will become clear as you read on.</p>
    <h4>HTTP and HTML: Berners-Lee&rsquo;s Basics</h4>
    <p>HTTP is a communication standard governing the requests and responses that take</p>
    <p>place between the browser running on the end user&rsquo;s computer and the web server.</p>
    <p>The server&rsquo;s job is to accept a request from the client and attempt to reply to it in a</p>
    <p>meaningful way, usually by serving up a requested web page&mdash;that&rsquo;s why the term</p>
    <p>server</p>
    <p>is used. The natural counterpart to a server is a</p>
    <p>client</p>
    <p>, so that term is applied</p>
    <p>both to the web browser and the computer on which it&rsquo;s running.</p>
    <p>Between the client and the server there can be several other devices, such as routers,</p>
    <p>proxies, gateways, and so on. They serve different roles in ensuring that the requests</p>
    <p>and responses are correctly transferred between the client and server. Typically, they</p>
    <p>use the Internet to send this information.</p>
    <p>A web server can usually handle multiple simultaneous connections and&mdash;when not</p>
    <p>communicating with a client&mdash;spends its time listening for an incoming connection.</p>
    <p>When one arrives, the server sends back a response to confirm its receipt.</p>
    <h3>The Request/Response Procedure</h3>
    <p>At its most basic level, the request/response process consists of a web browser asking</p>
    <p>the web server to send it a web page and the server sending back the page. The</p>
    <p>browser then takes care of displaying the page (see</p>
    <p>Figure 1-1</p>
    <p>).</p>
    <p>Figure 1-1. The basic client/server request/response sequence</p>
    <p>Each step in the request and response sequence is as follows:</p>
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>You enter</p>
    <p>http://server.com</p>
    <p>into your browser&rsquo;s address bar.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>Your browser looks up the IP address for</p>
    <p>server.com</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>3.</p>
    <p>Your browser issues a request for the home page at</p>
    <p>server.com</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>4.</p>
    <p>The request crosses the Internet and arrives at the</p>
    <p>server.com</p>
    <p>web server.</p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>The web server, having received the request, looks for the web page on its disk.</p>
    <p>6.</p>
    <p>The web page is retrieved by the server and returned to the browser.</p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>Your browser displays the web page.</p>
    <p>For an average web page, this process takes place once for each object within the</p>
    <p>page: a graphic, an embedded video or Flash file, and even a CSS template.</p>
    <p>In step 2, notice that the browser looked up the IP address of</p>
    <p>&nbsp;server.com</p>
    <p>. Every</p>
    <p>machine attached to the Internet has an IP address&mdash;your computer included. But we</p>
    <p>generally access web servers by name, such as</p>
    <p>google.com</p>
    <p>. As you probably know, the</p>
    <p>browser consults an additional Internet service called the Domain Name Service</p>
    <p>(DNS) to find its associated IP address and then uses it to communicate with the</p>
    <p>computer.</p>
    <p>For dynamic web pages, the procedure is a little more involved, because it may bring</p>
    <p>both PHP and MySQL into the mix (see</p>
    <p>Figure 1-2</p>
    <p>).</p>
    <p>Figure 1-2. A dynamic client/server request/response sequence</p>
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>You enter</p>
    <p>http://server.com</p>
    <p>into your browser&rsquo;s address bar.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>Your browser looks up the IP address for</p>
    <p>server.com</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>3.</p>
    <p>Your browser issues a request to that address for the web server&rsquo;s home page.</p>
    <p>4.</p>
    <p>The request crosses the Internet and arrives at the</p>
    <p>server.com</p>
    <p>web server.</p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>The web server, having received the request, fetches the home page from its hard</p>
    <p>disk.</p>
    <p>6.</p>
    <p>With the home page now in memory, the web server notices that it is a file incor‐</p>
    <p>porating PHP scripting and passes the page to the PHP interpreter.</p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>The PHP interpreter executes the PHP code.</p>
    <p>8.</p>
    <p>Some of the PHP contains MySQL statements, which the PHP interpreter now</p>
    <p>passes to the MySQL database engine.</p>
    <p>9.</p>
    <p>The MySQL database returns the results of the statements to the PHP interpreter.</p>
    <p>10.</p>
    <p>The PHP interpreter returns the results of the executed PHP code, along with the</p>
    <p>results from the MySQL database, to the web server.</p>
    <p>11.</p>
    <p>The web server returns the page to the requesting client, which displays it.</p>
    <p>Although it&rsquo;s helpful to be aware of this process so that you know how the three ele‐</p>
    <p>ments work together, in practice you don&rsquo;t really need to concern yourself with these</p>
    <p>details, because they all happen automatically.</p>
    <p>HTML pages returned to the browser in each example may well contain JavaScript,</p>
    <p>which will be interpreted locally by the client, and which could initiate another</p>
    <p>request&mdash;the same way embedded objects such as images would.</p>
    <h3>The Benefits of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5</h3>
    <p>At the start of this chapter, I introduced the world of Web 1.0, but it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
    <p>before the rush was on to create Web 1.1, with the development of such browser</p>
    <p>enhancements as Java, JavaScript, JScript (Microsoft&rsquo;s slight variant of JavaScript), and</p>
    <p>ActiveX. On the server side, progress was being made on the Common Gateway</p>
    <p>Interface (CGI) using scripting languages such as Perl (an alternative to the PHP lan‐</p>
    <p>guage) and</p>
    <p>server-side scripting</p>
    <p>&mdash;inserting the contents of one file (or the output of a</p>
    <p>system call) into another one dynamically.</p>
    <p>Once the dust had settled, three main technologies stood heads and shoulders above</p>
    <p>the others. Although Perl was still a popular scripting language with a strong follow‐</p>
    <p>ing, PHP&rsquo;s simplicity and built-in links to the MySQL database program had earned it</p>
    <p>more than double the number of users. And JavaScript, which had become an essen‐</p>
    <p>tial part of the equation for dynamically manipulating Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</p>
    <p>and HTML, now took on the even more muscular task of handling the client side of</p>
    <p>the Ajax process. Under Ajax, web pages perform data handling and send requests to</p>
    <p>web servers in the background&mdash;without the web user being aware that this is going</p>
    <p>on.</p>
    <p>No doubt the symbiotic nature of PHP and MySQL helped propel them both for‐</p>
    <p>ward, but what attracted developers to them in the first place? The simple answer has</p>
    <p>to be the ease with which you can use them to quickly create dynamic elements on</p>
    <p>websites. MySQL is a fast and powerful, yet easy-to-use, database system that offers</p>
    <p>just about anything a website would need in order to find and serve up data to brows‐</p>
    <p>ers. When PHP allies with MySQL to store and retrieve this data, you have the funda‐</p>
    <p>mental</p>
    <p>parts</p>
    <p>required</p>
    <p>for</p>
    <p>the</p>
    <p>development</p>
    <p>of</p>
    <p>social</p>
    <p>networking</p>
    <p>sites</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>the</p>
    <p>beginnings of Web 2.0.</p>
    <p>And when you bring JavaScript and CSS into the mix too, you have a recipe for build‐</p>
    <p>ing highly dynamic and interactive websites.</p>
    <h4>Using PHP</h4>
    <p>With PHP, it&rsquo;s a simple matter to embed dynamic activity in web pages. When you</p>
    <p>give pages the</p>
    <p>.php</p>
    <p>extension, they have instant access to the scripting language. From</p>
    <p>a developer&rsquo;s point of view, all you have to do is write code such as the following:</p>
    <p>&lt;?php</p>
    <p>echo " Today is " . date("l") . ". ";</p>
    <p>?&gt;</p>
    <p>Here's the latest news.</p>
    <p>The opening</p>
    <p>&lt;?php</p>
    <p>tells the web server to allow the PHP program to interpret all the</p>
    <p>following code up to the</p>
    <p>?&gt;</p>
    <p>tag. Outside of this construct, everything is sent to the</p>
    <p>client as direct HTML. So the text</p>
    <p>Here's the latest news.</p>
    <p>is simply output to the</p>
    <p>browser; within the PHP tags, the built-in</p>
    <p>date</p>
    <p>function displays the current day of</p>
    <p>the week according to the server&rsquo;s system time.</p>
    <p>The final output of the two parts looks like this:</p>
    <p>Today is Wednesday. Here's the latest news.</p>
    <p>PHP is a flexible language, and some people prefer to place the PHP construct</p>
    <p>directly next to PHP code, like this:</p>
    <p>Today is &lt;?php echo date("l"); ?&gt;. Here's the latest news.</p>
    <p>There are also other ways of formatting and outputting information, which I&rsquo;ll</p>
    <p>explain in the chapters on PHP. The point is that with PHP, web developers have a</p>
    <p>scripting language that, although not as fast as compiling your code in C or a similar</p>
    <p>language, is incredibly speedy and also integrates seamlessly with HTML markup.</p>
    <p>If you intend to enter the PHP examples in this book to work along</p>
    <p>with me, you must remember to add</p>
    <p>&lt;?php</p>
    <p>in front and</p>
    <p>?&gt;</p>
    <p>after</p>
    <p>them to ensure that the PHP interpreter processes them. To facili‐</p>
    <p>tate this, you may wish to prepare a file called</p>
    <p>&nbsp;example.php</p>
    <p>&nbsp;with</p>
    <p>those tags in place.</p>
    <p>Using PHP, you have unlimited control over your web server. Whether you need to</p>
    <p>modify HTML on the fly, process a credit card, add user details to a database, or fetch</p>
    <p>information from a third-party website, you can do it all from within the same PHP</p>
    <p>files in which the HTML itself resides.</p>
    <h4>Using MySQL</h4>
    <p>Of course, there&rsquo;s not a lot of point to being able to change HTML output dynami‐</p>
    <p>cally unless you also have a means to track the changes that users make as they use</p>
    <p>your website. In the early days of the Web, many sites used &ldquo;flat&rdquo; text files to store</p>
    <p>data such as usernames and passwords. But this approach could cause problems if the</p>
    <p>file wasn&rsquo;t correctly locked against corruption from multiple simultaneous accesses.</p>
    <p>Also, a flat file can get only so big before it becomes unwieldy to manage&mdash;not to</p>
    <p>mention the difficulty of trying to merge files and perform complex searches in any</p>
    <p>kind of reasonable time.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s where relational databases with structured querying become essential. And</p>
    <p>MySQL, being free to use and installed on vast numbers of Internet web servers, rises</p>
    <p>superbly to the occasion. It is a robust and exceptionally fast database management</p>
    <p>system that uses English-like commands.</p>
    <p>The highest level of MySQL structure is a database, within which you can have one</p>
    <p>or more tables that contain your data. For example, let&rsquo;s suppose you are working on</p>
    <p>a table called</p>
    <p>users</p>
    <p>, within which you have created columns for</p>
    <p>surname</p>
    <p>,</p>
    <p>firstname</p>
    <p>,</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>email</p>
    <p>, and you now wish to add another user. One command that you might use</p>
    <p>to do this is as follows:</p>
    <p>INSERT INTO users VALUES('Smith', 'John', 'jsmith@mysite.com');</p>
    <p>Of course, as mentioned earlier, you will have issued other commands to create the</p>
    <p>database and table and to set up all the correct fields, but the</p>
    <p>INSERT</p>
    <p>command here</p>
    <p>shows how simple it can be to add new data to a database.</p>
    <p>INSERT</p>
    <p>is an example of</p>
    <p>Structured Query Language (SQL), a language designed in the early 1970s and remi‐</p>
    <p>niscent of one of the oldest programming languages, COBOL. It is well suited, how‐</p>
    <p>ever, to database queries, which is why it is still in use after all this time.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s equally easy to look up data. Let&rsquo;s assume that you have an email address for a user</p>
    <p>and need to look up that person&rsquo;s name. To do this, you could issue a MySQL query</p>
    <p>such as the following:</p>
    <p>SELECT surname,firstname FROM users WHERE email='jsmith@mysite.com';</p>
    <p>MySQL will then return</p>
    <p>Smith, John</p>
    <p>and any other pairs of names that may be asso‐</p>
    <p>ciated with that email address in the database.</p>
    <p>As you&rsquo;d expect, there&rsquo;s quite a bit more that you can do with MySQL than just simple</p>
    <p>INSERT</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>SELECT</p>
    <p>commands. For example, you can join multiple tables according</p>
    <p>to various criteria, ask for results in a variety of orders, make partial matches when</p>
    <p>you know only part of the string that you are searching for, return only the</p>
    <p>n</p>
    <p>th result,</p>
    <p>and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Using PHP, you can make all these calls directly to MySQL without having to run the</p>
    <p>MySQL program yourself or use its command-line interface. This means you can save</p>
    <p>the results in arrays for processing and perform multiple lookups, each dependent on</p>
    <p>the results returned from earlier ones, to drill down to the item of data you need.</p>
    <p>For even more power, as you&rsquo;ll see later, there are additional functions built right into</p>
    <p>MySQL that you can call up for common operations and extra speed.</p>
    <h4>Using JavaScript</h4>
    <p>The oldest of the three core technologies in this book, JavaScript, was created to</p>
    <p>enable scripting access to all the elements of an HTML document. In other words, it</p>
    <p>provides a means for dynamic user interaction such as checking email address valid‐</p>
    <p>ity in input forms, and displaying prompts such as &ldquo;Did you really mean that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>(although it cannot be relied upon for security, which should always be performed on</p>
    <p>the web server).</p>
    <p>Combined with CSS (see the following section), JavaScript is the power behind</p>
    <p>dynamic web pages that change in front of your eyes rather than when a new page is</p>
    <p>returned by the server.</p>
    <p>However, JavaScript can also be tricky to use, due to some major differences in the</p>
    <p>ways different browser designers have chosen to implement it. This mainly came</p>
    <p>about when some manufacturers tried to put additional functionality into their</p>
    <p>browsers at the expense of compatibility with their rivals.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, the developers have mostly now come to their senses and have realized</p>
    <p>the need for full compatibility with one another, so they don&rsquo;t have to write multi-</p>
    <p>exception code. But there remain millions of legacy browsers that will be in use for a</p>
    <p>good many years to come. Luckily, there are solutions for the incompatibility prob‐</p>
    <p>lems, and later in this book we&rsquo;ll look at libraries and techniques that enable you to</p>
    <p>safely ignore these differences.</p>
    <p>For now, let&rsquo;s take a look at how to use basic JavaScript, accepted by all browsers:</p>
    <p>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;</p>
    <p>document.write("Today is " + Date() );</p>
    <p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
    <p>This code snippet tells the web browser to interpret everything within the</p>
    <p>script</p>
    <p>tags</p>
    <p>as JavaScript, which the browser then does by writing the text</p>
    <p>Today is</p>
    <p>to the current</p>
    <p>document, along with the date, by using the JavaScript function</p>
    <p>Date</p>
    <p>. The result will</p>
    <p>look something like this:</p>
    <p>Today is Sun Jan 01 2017 01:23:45</p>
    <p>Unless you need to specify an exact version of JavaScript, you can</p>
    <p>normally omit the</p>
    <p>type="text/javascript"</p>
    <p>and just use</p>
    <p>&lt;script&gt;</p>
    <p>to start the interpretation of the JavaScript.</p>
    <p>As previously mentioned, JavaScript was originally developed to offer dynamic con‐</p>
    <p>trol over the various elements within an HTML document, and that is still its main</p>
    <p>use. But more and more, JavaScript is being used for Ajax. This is a term for the pro‐</p>
    <p>cess of accessing the web server in the background. (It originally meant</p>
    <p>Asynchronous</p>
    <p>JavaScript and XML</p>
    <p>, but that phrase is already a bit outdated.)</p>
    <p>Ajax is the main process behind what is now known as Web 2.0 (a term popularized</p>
    <p>by Tim O&rsquo;Reilly, the founder and CEO of this book&rsquo;s publishing company), in which</p>
    <p>web pages have started to resemble standalone programs, because they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
    <p>be reloaded in their entirety. Instead, a quick Ajax call can pull in and update a single</p>
    <p>element on a web page, such as changing your photograph on a social networking site</p>
    <p>or replacing a button that you click with the answer to a question. This subject is fully</p>
    <p>covered in</p>
    <p>Chapter 17</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>Then, in</p>
    <p>Chapter 21</p>
    <p>, we take a good look at the jQuery framework, which you can</p>
    <p>use to save reinventing the wheel when you need fast, cross-browser code to manipu‐</p>
    <p>late your web pages. Of course, there are other frameworks available too, but jQuery</p>
    <p>is by far the most popular and, due to continuous maintenance, is extremely reliable,</p>
    <p>and a major tool in the utility kit of many seasoned web developers.</p>
    <h4>Using CSS</h4>
    <p>With the emergence of the CSS3 standard in recent years, CSS now offers a level of</p>
    <p>dynamic interactivity previously supported only by JavaScript. For example, not only</p>
    <p>can you style any HTML element to change its dimensions, colors, borders, spacing,</p>
    <p>and so on, but now you can also add animated transitions and transformations to</p>
    <p>your web pages, using only a few lines of CSS.</p>
    <p>Using CSS can be as simple as inserting a few rules between</p>
    <p>&lt;style&gt;</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>&lt;/style&gt;</p>
    <p>tags in the head of a web page, like this:</p>
    <p>&lt;style&gt;</p>
    <p>p {</p>
    <p>text-align:justify;</p>
    <p>font-family:Helvetica;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>&lt;/style&gt;</p>
    <p>These rules will change the default text alignment of the</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt;</p>
    <p>tag so that paragraphs</p>
    <p>contained in it will be fully justified and will use the Helvetica font.</p>
    <p>As you&rsquo;ll learn in</p>
    <p>Chapter 18</p>
    <p>, there are many different ways you can lay out CSS rules,</p>
    <p>and you can also include them directly within tags or save a set of rules to an external</p>
    <p>file to be loaded in separately. This flexibility not only lets you style your HTML pre‐</p>
    <p>cisely, but it can also (for example) provide built-in hover functionality to animate</p>
    <p>objects as the mouse passes over them. You will also learn how to access all of an ele‐</p>
    <p>ment&rsquo;s CSS properties from JavaScript as well as HTML.</p>
    <h3>And Then There&rsquo;s HTML5</h3>
    <p>As useful as all these additions to the web standards became, they were not enough</p>
    <p>for ever more ambitious developers. For example, there was still no simple way to</p>
    <p>manipulate graphics in a web browser without resorting to plug-ins such as Flash.</p>
    <p>And the same went for inserting audio and video into web pages. Plus, several annoy‐</p>
    <p>ing inconsistencies had crept into HTML during its evolution.</p>
    <p>So, to clear all this up and take the Internet beyond Web 2.0 and into its next itera‐</p>
    <p>tion, a new standard for HTML was created to address all these shortcomings. It was</p>
    <p>called</p>
    <p>HTML5</p>
    <p>and it began development as long ago as 2004, when the first draft was</p>
    <p>drawn up by the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software (developers of two popular</p>
    <p>web browsers). But it wasn&rsquo;t until the start of 2013 that the final draft was submitted</p>
    <p>to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the international governing body for</p>
    <p>web standards.</p>
    <p>With nine years for it to develop, you might think that would be the end of the speci‐</p>
    <p>fication, but that&rsquo;s not how things work on the Internet. Although websites come and</p>
    <p>go at great speed, the underlying software is developed slowly and carefully, and so</p>
    <p>the stable recommendation for HTML5 is expected only after this edition of the book</p>
    <p>has been published&mdash;in late 2014. And then guess what? Work will move on to ver‐</p>
    <p>sions 5.1 and higher, beginning in 2015. It&rsquo;s a never-ending cycle of development.</p>
    <p>However, while HTML5.1 is planned to bring some handy improvements (mainly to</p>
    <p>the canvas), basic HTML5 is the new standard web developers now need to work to,</p>
    <p>and it will remain in place for many years to come. So learning everything you can</p>
    <p>about it now will stand you in very good stead.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s actually a great deal of new stuff in HTML (and quite a few things that have</p>
    <p>been changed or removed), but in summary, here&rsquo;s what you get:</p>
    <p>Markup</p>
    <p>Including new elements such as</p>
    <p>&lt;nav&gt;</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>&lt;footer&gt;</p>
    <p>, and deprecated elements like</p>
    <p>&lt;font&gt;</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>&lt;center&gt;</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>New APIs</p>
    <p>Such as the</p>
    <p>&lt;canvas&gt;</p>
    <p>element for writing and drawing on a graphics canvas,</p>
    <p>&lt;audio&gt;</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>&lt;video&gt;</p>
    <p>elements, offline web applications, microdata, and local storage.</p>
    <p>Applications</p>
    <p>Including two new rendering technologies: MathML (Math Markup Language) for</p>
    <p>displaying mathematical formulae and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for creating</p>
    <p>graphical elements outside of the new</p>
    <p>&lt;canvas&gt;</p>
    <p>element. However, MathML and</p>
    <p>SVG are somewhat specialist, and are so feature-packed they would need a book of</p>
    <p>their own, so I don&rsquo;t cover them here.</p>
    <p>All these things (and more) are covered in detail starting in</p>
    <p>Chapter 22</p>
    <p>.</p>
    <p>One of the little things I like about the HTML5 specification is that</p>
    <p>XHTML syntax is no longer required for self-closing elements. In</p>
    <p>the past, you could display a line break using the</p>
    <p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
    <p>element.</p>
    <p>Then, to ensure future compatibility with XHTML (the planned</p>
    <p>replacement for HTML that never happened), this was changed to</p>
    <p>&lt;br /&gt;</p>
    <p>, in which a closing</p>
    <p>/</p>
    <p>character was added (since all ele‐</p>
    <p>ments were expected to include a closing tag featuring this charac‐</p>
    <p>ter). But now things have gone full circle, and you can use either</p>
    <p>version of these types of element. So, for the sake of brevity and</p>
    <p>fewer keystrokes, in this book I have reverted to the former style of</p>
    <p>&lt;br&gt;</p>
    <p>,</p>
    <p>&lt;hr&gt;</p>
    <p>, and so on.</p>
    <h3>The Apache Web Server</h3>
    <p>In addition to PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5, there&rsquo;s a sixth hero in the</p>
    <p>dynamic Web: the web server. In the case of this book, that means the Apache web</p>
    <p>server. We&rsquo;ve discussed a little of what a web server does during the HTTP server/</p>
    <p>client exchange, but it does much more behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>For example, Apache doesn&rsquo;t serve up just HTML files&mdash;it handles a wide range of</p>
    <p>files from images and Flash files to MP3 audio files, RSS (Really Simple Syndication)</p>
    <p>feeds, and so on. To do this, each element a web client encounters in an HTML page</p>
    <p>is also requested from the server, which then serves it up.</p>
    <p>But these objects don&rsquo;t have to be static files such as GIF images. They can all be gen‐</p>
    <p>erated by programs such as PHP scripts. That&rsquo;s right: PHP can even create images and</p>
    <p>other files for you, either on the fly or in advance to serve up later.</p>
    <p>To do this, you normally have modules either precompiled into Apache or PHP or</p>
    <p>called up at runtime. One such module is the GD (Graphics Draw) library, which</p>
    <p>PHP uses to create and handle graphics.</p>
    <p>Apache also supports a huge range of modules of its own. In addition to the PHP</p>
    <p>module, the most important for your purposes as a web programmer are the modules</p>
    <p>that handle security. Other examples are the Rewrite module, which enables the web</p>
    <p>server to handle a varying range of URL types and rewrite them to its own internal</p>
    <p>requirements, and the Proxy module, which you can use to serve up often-requested</p>
    <p>pages from a cache to ease the load on the server.</p>
    <p>Later in the book, you&rsquo;ll see how to use some of these modules to enhance the fea‐</p>
    <p>tures provided by the three core technologies.</p>
    <h3>About Open Source</h3>
    <p>Whether or not being open source is the reason these technologies are so popular has</p>
    <p>often been debated, but PHP, MySQL, and Apache</p>
    <p>are</p>
    <p>the three most commonly used</p>
    <p>tools in their categories. What can be said definitively, though, is that their being</p>
    <p>open source means that they have been developed in the community by teams of pro‐</p>
    <p>grammers writing the features they themselves want and need, with the original code</p>
    <p>available for all to see and change. Bugs can be found and security breaches can be</p>
    <p>prevented before they happen.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s another benefit: all these programs are free to use. There&rsquo;s no worrying about</p>
    <p>having to purchase additional licenses if you have to scale up your website and add</p>
    <p>more servers. And you don&rsquo;t need to check the budget before deciding whether to</p>
    <p>upgrade to the latest versions of these products.</p>
    <h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>
    <p>The real beauty of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript (sometimes aided by jQuery or other</p>
    <p>frameworks), CSS, and HTML5 is the wonderful way in which they all work together</p>
    <p>to produce dynamic web content: PHP handles all the main work on the web server,</p>
    <p>MySQL manages all the data, and the combination of CSS and JavaScript looks after</p>
    <p>web page presentation. JavaScript can also talk with your PHP code on the web server</p>
    <p>whenever it needs to update something (either on the server or on the web page).</p>
    <p>And with the powerful new features in HTML5, such as the canvas, audio and video,</p>
    <p>and geolocation, you can make your web pages highly dynamic, interactive, and</p>
    <p>multimedia-packed.</p>
    <p>Without using program code, let&rsquo;s summarize the contents of this chapter by looking</p>
    <p>at the process of combining some of these technologies into an everyday Ajax feature</p>
    <p>that many websites use: checking whether a desired username already exists on the</p>
    <p>site when a user is signing up for a new account. A good example of this can be seen</p>
    <p>with Gmail (see</p>
    <p>Figure 1-3</p>
    <p>).</p>
    <p>Figure 1-3. Gmail uses Ajax to check the availability of usernames</p>
    <p>The steps involved in this Ajax process would be similar to the following:</p>
    <p>1.</p>
    <p>The server outputs the HTML to create the web form, which asks for the neces‐</p>
    <p>sary details, such as username, first name, last name, and email address.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the server attaches some JavaScript to the HTML to monitor</p>
    <p>the username input box and check for two things: (a) whether some text has been</p>
    <p>typed into it, and (b) whether the input has been deselected because the user has</p>
    <p>clicked on another input box.</p>
    <p>3.</p>
    <p>Once the text has been entered and the field deselected, in the background the</p>
    <p>JavaScript code passes the username that was entered back to a PHP script on the</p>
    <p>web server and awaits a response.</p>
    <p>4.</p>
    <p>The web server looks up the username and replies back to the JavaScript regard‐</p>
    <p>ing whether that name has already been taken.</p>
    <p>5.</p>
    <p>The JavaScript then places an indication next to the username input box to show</p>
    <p>whether the name is one available to the user&mdash;perhaps a green checkmark or a</p>
    <p>red cross graphic, along with some text.</p>
    <p>6.</p>
    <p>If the username is not available and the user still submits the form, the JavaScript</p>
    <p>interrupts</p>
    <p>the</p>
    <p>submission</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>reemphasizes</p>
    <p>(perhaps</p>
    <p>with</p>
    <p>a</p>
    <p>larger</p>
    <p>graphic</p>
    <p>and/or an alert box) that the user needs to choose another username.</p>
    <p>7.</p>
    <p>Optionally, an improved version of this process could even look at the username</p>
    <p>requested by the user and suggest an alternative that is currently available.</p>
    <p>All of this takes place quietly in the background and makes for a comfortable and</p>
    <p>seamless user experience. Without Ajax, the entire form would have to be submitted</p>
    <p>to the server, which would then send back HTML, highlighting any mistakes. It</p>
    <p>would be a workable solution, but nowhere near as tidy or pleasurable as on-the-fly</p>
    <p>form-field processing.</p>
    <p>Ajax can be used for a lot more than simple input verification and processing,</p>
    <p>though; we&rsquo;ll explore many additional things that you can do with it in the Ajax chap‐</p>
    <p>ters later in this book.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, you have read a good introduction to the core technologies of PHP,</p>
    <p>MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 (as well as Apache), and have learned how they</p>
    <p>work together. In</p>
    <p>Chapter 2</p>
    <p>, we&rsquo;ll look at how you can install your own web develop‐</p>
    <p>ment server on which to practice everything that you will be learning.</p>
