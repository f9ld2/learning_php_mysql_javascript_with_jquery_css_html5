  <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="para">
   db++, made by the German company <a href="http://www.concept-asa.de/index_gb.html" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;Concept asa</a>, is a relational
   database system with high performance and low memory and disk
   usage in mind. While providing SQL as an additional language
   interface, it is not really an SQL database in the first place but
   provides its own AQL query language which is much more influenced
   by the relational algebra than SQL is.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Concept asa always had an interest in supporting open source
   languages, db++ has had Perl and Tcl call interfaces for years
   now and uses Tcl as its internal stored procedure language.
