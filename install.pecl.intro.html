  <h2 class="title">Introduction to PECL Installations</h2>
  <p class="simpara">
   <a href="http://pecl.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;PECL</a> is a repository of PHP extensions that
   are made available to you via the <a href="http://pear.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;PEAR</a>
   packaging system.  This section of the manual is intended to demonstrate
   how to obtain and install PECL extensions.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   These instructions assume <em>/your/phpsrcdir/</em> is the path
   to the PHP source distribution, and that <em>extname</em> is the name of the
   PECL extension.  Adjust accordingly.  These instructions also assume a 
   familiarity with the <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;pear command</a>.
   The information in the PEAR manual for the <em>pear</em> command also
   applies to the <em>pecl</em> command.

   To be useful, a shared extension must be built, installed, and loaded.  The
   methods described below provide you with various instructions on how to
   build and install the extensions, but they do not automatically load them.
   Extensions can be loaded by adding an <a href="ini.core.html#ini.extension" class="link">extension</a> directive to the <var class="filename">php.ini</var>
   file, or through the use of the <span class="function"><a href="function.dl.html" class="function">dl()</a></span> function.

   When building PHP modules, it&apos;s important to have known-good versions 
   of the required tools (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.) See the 
   <a href="http://www.php.net/git.php" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;Anonymous Git Instructions</a> for 
   details on the required tools, and required versions.
