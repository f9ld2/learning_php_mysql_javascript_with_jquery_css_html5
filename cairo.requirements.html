    Cairo is only available for PHP 5.2+ and PHP 5.3+ The extension also requires
    the cairo graphics library version 1.4 or higher. The cairo graphics library
    uses an even and odd numbering scheme to denote stable and unstable library
    versions. Both unstable and stable versions can be used with the extension,
    but conditional support for new features is determined by the stable version
    below the unstable version in use. The latest cairo release can be found at
    <a href="http://cairographics.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://cairographics.org/</a>.
