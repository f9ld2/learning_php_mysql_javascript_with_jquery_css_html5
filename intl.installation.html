 <h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
 <p class="para">
  This extension may be installed using the bundled version as of PHP 5.3.0,
  or as a PECL extension as of PHP 5.2.0. In other words, there are two methods
  to install the intl extension.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Information for installing this PECL extension may be
found in the manual chapter titled <a href="install.pecl.html" class="link">Installation
of PECL extensions</a>. Additional information such as new releases,
downloads, source files, maintainer information, and a CHANGELOG, can be
located here: 
  <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/intl" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://pecl.php.net/package/intl</a>.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Alternatively, <em>--enable-intl</em> will enable the bundled
  version while compiling PHP.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  If your ICU is installed to a non-standard directory then you might want to
  specify its location in
  <strong><code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code></strong>
  environment variable so that dynamic linker can find it:
 </p>
 <div class="example-contents screen">$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/icu/lib</div>
 <p class="para">
  Otherwise, if PHP and ICU are installed to their default locations, then the
  additional options to `configure&apos; are not needed.
