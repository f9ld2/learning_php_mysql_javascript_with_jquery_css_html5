   PHP 5 comes with a complete reflection API that adds the ability to
   <em>reverse-engineer</em> classes, interfaces, functions,
   methods and extensions. Additionally, the reflection API offers ways to
   retrieve doc comments for functions, classes and methods.

  <p class="para">
   Please note that certain parts of the internal <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>
   are missing the necessary code to work with the Reflection extension.
   E.g., an internal PHP class might be missing reflection data for
   properties. These few cases are considered bugs, however, so they
   should be discovered and fixed.
