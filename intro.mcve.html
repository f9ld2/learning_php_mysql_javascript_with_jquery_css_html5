  <p class="para">
   These functions interface the MCVE (Monetra) API (libmonetra, 
   formerly known as libmcve), allowing you
   to work directly with MCVE/Monetra from your PHP scripts.  
   MCVE/Monetra is Main Street Softworks&apos; solution to direct
   credit/debit/gift card processing for Linux/Unix/MacOSX/Windows
   ( <a href="http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/</a> ).
   It lets you directly address the credit card clearing houses via
   your *nix box, modem and/or internet connection (bypassing the
   need for an additional service such as Authorize.Net or Pay
   Flow Pro).  Using the MCVE/Monetra module for PHP, you can process
   credit cards directly through MCVE/Monetra via your PHP scripts.
   The following references will outline the process.
