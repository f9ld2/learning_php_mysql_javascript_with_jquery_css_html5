  Session support is enabled in PHP by default. If you would
  not like to build your PHP with session support, you should
  specify the <strong class="option configure">--disable-session</strong>

  option to configure. To use shared memory allocation (mm) for session
  storage configure PHP <strong class="option configure">--with-mm[=DIR] </strong>
.
 </p>
 <p class="simpara">The Windows version of PHP has built-in
support for this extension. You do not need to load any additional
extensions in order to use these functions.</p>

   By default, all data related to a particular session will be stored in
   a file in the directory specified by the session.save_path INI option.
   A file for each session (regardless of if any data is associated with
   that session) will be created. This is due to the fact that a session
   is opened (a file is created) but no data is even written to that file.
   Note that this behavior is a side-effect of the limitations of working
   with the file system and it is possible that a custom session handler
   (such as one which uses a database) does not keep track of sessions
   which store no data.
