 <h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
 <p class="para">
  In order to build this extension yourself you need the db++ client libraries
  and header files to be installed on your system (these are included in the
  db++ installation archives by default). You have to run
  <strong class="command">configure</strong> with option <strong class="option unknown">--with-dbplus</strong>
 to
  build this extension.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <strong class="command">configure</strong> looks for the client libraries and header files
  under the default paths <var class="filename">/usr/dbplus</var>,
  <var class="filename">/usr/local/dbplus</var> and <var class="filename">/opt/dblus</var>.
  If you have installed db++ in a different place you have add the installation
  path to the <strong class="command">configure</strong> option like this:
  <strong class="option unknown">--with-dbplus=/your/installation/path</strong>
.
