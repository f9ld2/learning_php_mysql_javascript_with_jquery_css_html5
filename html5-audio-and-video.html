<h2>HTML5 Audio and Video</h2>
<span>One of the biggest driving forces behind the growth of the Internet has been the insa‐</span>
<span>tiable demand from users for ever more multimedia in the form of audio and video.</span>
<span>Initially, bandwidth was so precious that there was no such thing as live streaming,</span>
<span>and it could take minutes or even hours to download an audio track, let alone a video.</span>
<span>The high cost of bandwidth and limited availability of fast modems drove the devel‐</span>
<span>opment of faster and more efficient compression algorithms, such as MP3 audio and</span>
<span>MPEG video, but even then the only way to download files in any reasonable length</span>
<span>of time was to drastically reduce their quality.</span>
<span>One of my earlier Internet projects, back in 1997, was the UK&rsquo;s first online radio sta‐</span>
<span>tion licensed by the music authorities. Actually, it was more of a podcast (before the</span>
<span>term was coined) because we made a daily half-hour show and then compressed it</span>
<span>down to 8-bit, 11KHz mono using an algorithm originally developed for telephony,</span>
<span>and it sounded like phone quality, or worse. Still, we quickly gained thousands of lis‐</span>
<span>teners who would download the show and then listen to it as they surfed to the sites</span>
<span>discussed in it by means of a pop-up browser window containing a plug-in.</span>
<span>Thankfully for us, and everyone publishing multimedia, it soon became possible to</span>
<span>offer greater audio and video quality, but still only by asking the user to download</span>
<span>and install a plug-in player. Flash became the most popular of these players, after</span>
<span>beating rivals such as RealAudio, but it gained a bad reputation as the cause of many a</span>
<span>browser crash, and constantly required upgrading when new versions were released.</span>
<span>So it was generally agreed that the way ahead was to come up with some web stand‐</span>
<span>ards for supporting multimedia directly within the browser. Of course, browser</span>
<span>developers such as Microsoft and Google had differing visions of what these stand‐</span>
<span>ards should look like, but after the dust had settled, they had agreed on a subset of file</span>
<span>types that all browsers should play natively, and these were introduced into the</span>
<span>HTML5 specification.</span>
<span>Finally, it is possible (as long as you encode your audio and video in a few different</span>
<span>formats) to upload multimedia to a web server, place a couple of HTML tags in a web</span>
<span>page, and have the media play on any major desktop browser, smartphone, or tablet</span>
<span>device, without the user having to download a plug-in or make any other changes.</span>
<span>There are still a lot of older browsers out there, so Flash remains</span>
<span>important for supporting them. In this chapter, I show you how to</span>
<span>add code to use Flash as a backup to HTML5 audio and video, to</span>
<span>cover as many hardware and software combinations as possible.</span>
<h3>About Codecs</h3>
<span>The term</span>
<span>codec</span>
<span>stands for en</span>
<span>co</span>
<span>der/</span>
<span>dec</span>
<span>oder. It describes the functionality provided by</span>
<span>software that encodes and decodes media such as audio and video. In HTML5 there</span>
<span>are a number of different sets of codecs available, depending on the browser used.</span>
<span>Following are the codecs supported by the HTML5</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>tag (and also when audio</span>
<span>is attached to HTML5 video):</span>
<span>AAC</span>
<span>This audio codec, which stands for Advanced Audio Encoding, is used by Apple&rsquo;s</span>
<span>iTunes store, and is a proprietary patented technology supported by Apple, Google,</span>
<span>and Microsoft. It generally uses the</span>
<span>.aac</span>
<span>file extension. Its mime type is</span>
<span>audio/aac</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>MP3</span>
<span>This audio codec, which stands for MPEG Audio Layer 3, has been available for</span>
<span>many years. While the term is often (incorrectly) used to refer to any type of digital</span>
<span>audio, it is a proprietary patented technology that is supported by Apple, Google,</span>
<span>Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft. The file extension it uses is</span>
<span>&nbsp;.mp3</span>
<span>. Its mime type is</span>
<span>audio/mpeg</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>PCM</span>
<span>This audio codec, which stands for Pulse Coded Modulation, stores the full data as</span>
<span>encoded by an analog-to-digital converter, and is the format used for storing data on</span>
<span>audio CDs. Because it does not use compression, it is called a</span>
<span>lossless</span>
<span>codec and its</span>
<span>files are generally many times larger than AAC or MP3 files. It is supported by Apple,</span>
<span>Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. Usually this type of file has the extension</span>
<span>.wav</span>
<span>. Its mime</span>
<span>type is</span>
<span>audio/wav</span>
<span>, but you may also see</span>
<span>audio/wave</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Vorbis</span>
<span>Sometimes referred to as Ogg Vorbis&mdash;because it generally uses the</span>
<span>.ogg</span>
<span>file extension</span>
<span>&mdash;</span>
<span>this audio codec is unencumbered by patents and free of royalty payments. It is</span>
<span>supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera. Its mime type is</span>
<span>audio/</span>
<span>ogg</span>
<span>, or sometimes</span>
<span>audio/oga</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>The following list summarizes the major operating systems and browsers, along with</span>
<span>the audio types their latest versions support:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Apple iOS</span>
<span>: AAC, MP3, PCM</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Apple Safari</span>
<span>: AAC, MP3, PCM</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Google Android</span>
<span>: 2.3+ AAC, MP3, Vorbis</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Google Chrome</span>
<span>: AAC, MP3, Vorbis</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Microsoft Internet Explorer</span>
<span>: AAC, MP3</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Mozilla Firefox</span>
<span>: MP3, PCM, Vorbis</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Opera</span>
<span>: PCM, Vorbis</span>
<span>The outcome of these different levels of codec support is that you always need at least</span>
<span>two versions of each audio file to ensure it will play on all platforms. One of these</span>
<span>should be Vorbis to support Opera, but for the second you have a choice of either</span>
<span>AAC or MP3.</span>
<h3>The &lt;audio&gt; Element</h3>
<span>To cater to all platforms, you need to record or convert your content using multiple</span>
<span>codecs and then list them all within</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>&lt;/audio&gt;</span>
<span>tags, as in</span>
<span>Example 24-1</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>The nested</span>
<span>&lt;source&gt;</span>
<span>tags then contain the various media you wish to offer to a</span>
<span>browser. Because the</span>
<span>controls</span>
<span>attribute is supplied, the result looks like</span>
<span>Figure 24-1</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 24-1. Embedding three</span>
<span>different types of audio files</span>
<span>&lt;audio controls&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.m4a' type='audio/aac'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.mp3' type='audio/mp3'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.ogg' type='audio/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/audio&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 24-1. Playing an audio file</span>
<span>In this example I included three different audio types, because that&rsquo;s perfectly accepta‐</span>
<span>ble, and can be a good idea if you wish to ensure that each browser can locate its pre‐</span>
<span>ferred format rather than just one it knows how to handle. However, the example will</span>
<span>still play on all platforms if one or the other (but not both) of the MP3 or the AAC</span>
<span>files is dropped.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>element and its partner</span>
<span>&lt;source&gt;</span>
<span>tag support several attributes:</span>
<span>autoplay</span>
<span>Causes the audio to start playing as soon as it is ready</span>
<span>controls</span>
<span>Causes the control panel to be displayed</span>
<span>loop</span>
<span>Sets the audio to play over and over</span>
<span>preload</span>
<span>Causes the audio to begin loading even before the user selects Play</span>
<span>src</span>
<span>Specifies the source location of an audio file</span>
<span>type</span>
<span>Specifies the codec used in creating the audio</span>
<span>If you don&rsquo;t supply the</span>
<span>controls</span>
<span>attribute to the</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>tag, and don&rsquo;t use the</span>
<span>auto</span>
<span>play</span>
<span>attribute either, the sound will not play and there won&rsquo;t be a Play button for the</span>
<span>user to click to start playback. This would leave you no option other than to offer this</span>
<span>functionality in JavaScript, as in</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 24-2</span>
<span>&nbsp;(with the additional code required</span>
<span>highlighted in bold), which provides the ability to play and pause the audio, as shown</span>
<span>in</span>
<span>Figure 24-2</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 24-2. Playing audio using JavaScript</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;title&gt;Playing Audio with JavaScript&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script src='OSC.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;audio</span>
<span>id='myaudio'</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.m4a' type='audio/aac'&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.mp3' type='audio/mp3'&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.ogg' type='audio/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/audio&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;button onclick='playaudio()'&gt;Play Audio&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;button onclick='pauseaudio()'&gt;Pause Audio&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span>function playaudio()</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>O('myaudio').play()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function pauseaudio()</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>O('myaudio').pause()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 24-2. HTML5 audio can be controlled with JavaScript</span>
<span>This works by calling the</span>
<span>play</span>
<span>or</span>
<span>pause</span>
<span>methods of the</span>
<span>myaudio</span>
<span>element when the</span>
<span>buttons are clicked.</span>
<h3>Supporting Non-HTML5 Browsers</h3>
<span>It will probably be necessary to support older browsers for the foreseeable future by</span>
<span>providing a fallback to Flash.</span>
<span>Example 24-3</span>
<span>shows how you can do this using a Flash</span>
<span>plug-in saved as</span>
<span>&nbsp;audioplayer.swf</span>
<span>&nbsp;(available, along with all the examples, in the free</span>
<span>download at the</span>
<span>http://lpmj.net</span>
<span>companion website). The code to add is highlighted</span>
<span>in bold.</span>
<span>Example 24-3. Providing a Flash fallback for non-HTML5 browsers</span>
<span>&lt;audio controls&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash"</span>
<span>data="audioplayer.swf" width="300" height="30"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;param name="FlashVars"</span>
<span>value="mp3=audio.mp3&amp;showstop=1&amp;showvolume=1"&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/object&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.m4a' type='audio/aac'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.mp3' type='audio/mp3'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='audio.ogg' type='audio/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/audio&gt;</span>
<span>Here we take advantage of the fact that on non-HTML5 browsers, anything inside the</span>
<span>&lt;audio&gt;</span>
<span>tag (other than the</span>
<span>&lt;source&gt;</span>
<span>elements, which are ignored) will be acted on</span>
<span>by the browser. Therefore, by placing an</span>
<span>&lt;object&gt;</span>
<span>element there that calls up a Flash</span>
<span>player, we ensure that any non-HTML5 browsers will at least have a chance of playing</span>
<span>the audio, as long as they have Flash installed, as shown in</span>
<span>Figure 24-3</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Figure 24-3. The Flash audio player has been loaded</span>
<span>The particular audio player used in this example,</span>
<span>audioplayer.swf</span>
<span>, takes the following</span>
<span>arguments and values to the</span>
<span>FlashVars</span>
<span>attribute of the</span>
<span>&lt;param&gt;</span>
<span>element:</span>
<span>mp3</span>
<span>The URL of an MP3 audio file.</span>
<span>showstop</span>
<span>If</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, shows the Stop button; otherwise, it is not displayed.</span>
<span>showvolume</span>
<span>If</span>
<span>1</span>
<span>, shows the volume bar; otherwise, it is not displayed.</span>
<span>As with many elements, you can easily resize the object to (for example) 300&times;30 pix‐</span>
<span>els by providing these values to its</span>
<span>width</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>height</span>
<span>attributes.</span>
<h3>The &lt;video&gt; Element</h3>
<span>Playing video in HTML5 is quite similar to audio; you just use the</span>
<span>&lt;video&gt;</span>
<span>tag and</span>
<span>provide</span>
<span>&lt;source&gt;</span>
<span>elements for the media you are offering.</span>
<span>Example 24-4</span>
<span>shows how</span>
<span>you do this with three different video codec types, as displayed in</span>
<span>Figure 24-4</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 24-4. Playing HTML5 video</span>
<span>&lt;video width='560' height='320' controls&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.mp4' type='video/mp4'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.webm' type='video/webm'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.ogv' type='video/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/video&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 24-4. Playing HTML5 video</span>
<h4>The Video Codecs</h4>
<span>As with audio, there are a number of video codecs available, with differing support</span>
<span>across multiple browsers. These codecs come in different containers, as follows:</span>
<span>MP4</span>
<span>A license-encumbered, multimedia container format standard specified as a part of</span>
<span>MPEG-4, supported by Apple, Microsoft, and, to a lesser extent Google, since it has</span>
<span>its own WebM container format. Its mime type is</span>
<span>video/mp4</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>OGG</span>
<span>A free, open container format maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation. The creators</span>
<span>of the OGG format state that it is unrestricted by software patents and is designed to</span>
<span>provide for efficient streaming and manipulation of high-quality digital multimedia.</span>
<span>Its mime type is</span>
<span>video/ogg</span>
<span>, or sometimes</span>
<span>video/ogv</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>WebM</span>
<span>An audio-video format designed to provide a royalty-free, open video compression</span>
<span>format for use with HTML5 video. The project&rsquo;s development is sponsored by Goo‐</span>
<span>gle. There are two versions: VP8 and the newer VP9. Its mime type is</span>
<span>video/webm</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>These may then contain one of the following video codecs:</span>
<span>H.264</span>
<span>A patented, proprietary video codec for which playback is free for the end user, but</span>
<span>which may incur royalty fees for all parts of the encoding and transmission process.</span>
<span>At the time of writing, all of Apple, Google, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet</span>
<span>Explorer support this codec, while Opera (the remaining major browser) doesn&rsquo;t.</span>
<span>Theora</span>
<span>This is a video codec unencumbered by patents, and free of royalty payments at all</span>
<span>levels of encoding, transmission, and playback. This codec is supported by Google</span>
<span>Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.</span>
<span>VP8</span>
<span>This video codec is similar to Theora but is owned by Google, which has published it</span>
<span>as open source, making it royalty free. It is supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla</span>
<span>Firefox, and Opera.</span>
<span>VP9</span>
<span>As VP8 but more powerful, using half the bitrate.</span>
<span>The following list details the major operating systems and browsers, along with the</span>
<span>video types their latest versions support:</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Apple iOS</span>
<span>: MP4/H.264</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Apple Safari</span>
<span>: MP4/H.264</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Google Android</span>
<span>: MP4, OGG, WebM/H.264, Theora, VP8</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Google Chrome</span>
<span>: MP4, OGG, WebM/H.264, Theora, VP8, VP9</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Internet Explorer</span>
<span>: MP4/H.264</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Mozilla Firefox</span>
<span>: MP4, OGG, WebM/H.264, Theora, VP8, VP9</span>
<span>&bull;</span>
<span>Opera</span>
<span>: OGG, WebM/Theora, VP8</span>
<span>Looking at this list, it&rsquo;s clear that MP4/H.264 is almost unanimously supported,</span>
<span>except for the Opera browser. So if you&rsquo;re prepared to ignore the 1 percent or so of</span>
<span>users this comprises (and hope that Opera will soon have to adopt the format any‐</span>
<span>way), you need to supply your video using only one file type: MP4/H.264. But for</span>
<span>maximum viewing, you really ought to encode in OGG/Theora or OGG/VP8 as well</span>
<span>(but not VP9, as it&rsquo;s not yet been adopted by Opera).</span>
<span>Therefore, the</span>
<span>movie.webm</span>
<span>file in</span>
<span>Example 24-4</span>
<span>isn&rsquo;t strictly needed, but shows how</span>
<span>you can add all the different file types you like, to give browsers the opportunity to</span>
<span>play back the formats they prefer.</span>
<span>The</span>
<span>&lt;video&gt;</span>
<span>element</span>
<span>and</span>
<span>accompanying</span>
<span>&lt;source&gt;</span>
<span>tag</span>
<span>support</span>
<span>the</span>
<span>following</span>
<span>attributes:</span>
<span>autoplay</span>
<span>Causes the video to start playing as soon as it is ready</span>
<span>controls</span>
<span>Causes the control panel to be displayed</span>
<span>height</span>
<span>Specifies the height at which to display the video</span>
<span>loop</span>
<span>Sets the video to play over and over</span>
<span>muted</span>
<span>Mutes the audio output</span>
<span>poster</span>
<span>Lets you choose an image to display where the video will play</span>
<span>preload</span>
<span>Causes the video to begin loading before the user selects Play</span>
<span>src</span>
<span>Specifies the source location of a video file</span>
<span>type</span>
<span>Specifies the codec used in creating the video</span>
<span>width</span>
<span>Specifies the width at which to display the video</span>
<span>If you wish to control video playback from JavaScript, you can do so using code such</span>
<span>as that in</span>
<span>Example 24-5</span>
<span>(with the additional code required highlighted in bold), and</span>
<span>shown in</span>
<span>Figure 24-5</span>
<span>.</span>
<span>Example 24-5. Controlling video playback from JavaScript</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;title&gt;Playing Video with JavaScript&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script src='OSC.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;video</span>
<span>id='myvideo'</span>
<span>width='560' height='320'&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.mp4' type='video/mp4'&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.webm' type='video/webm'&gt;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.ogv' type='video/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/video&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;button onclick='playvideo()'&gt;Play Video&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;button onclick='pausevideo()'&gt;Pause Video&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span>function playvideo()</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>O('myvideo').play()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function pausevideo()</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>O('myvideo').pause()</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 24-5. JavaScript is being used to control the video</span>
<span>This code is just like controlling audio from JavaScript. Simply call the</span>
<span>play</span>
<span>and/or</span>
<span>pause</span>
<span>methods of the</span>
<span>myvideo</span>
<span>object to play and pause the video.</span>
<h4>Supporting Older Browsers</h4>
<span>Also as with audio, older versions of browsers will still be in general use for a while to</span>
<span>come, so it makes sense to offer a Flash video fallback to people with non-HTML5</span>
<span>browsers.</span>
<span>&nbsp;Example 24-6</span>
<span>&nbsp;shows you how to do this (highlighted in bold) using the</span>
<span>flowplayer.swf</span>
<span>file (available in the free download at</span>
<span>http://lpmj.net</span>
<span>), and</span>
<span>Figure 24-6</span>
<span>shows how it displays in a browser that doesn&rsquo;t support HTML5 video.</span>
<span>Example 24-6. Providing Flash as a fallback video player</span>
<span>&lt;video width='560' height='320' controls&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;object width='560' height='320'</span>
<span>type='application/x-shockwave-flash'</span>
<span>data='flowplayer.swf'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;param name='movie' value='flowplayer.swf'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;param name='flashvars'</span>
<span>value='config={"clip": {</span>
<span>"url": "http://tinyurl.com/html5video-mp4",</span>
<span>"autoPlay":false, "autoBuffering":true}}'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/object&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.mp4' type='video/mp4'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.webm' type='video/webm'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;source src='movie.ogv' type='video/ogg'&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/video&gt;</span>
<span>Figure 24-6. Flash provides a handy fallback for non-HTML5 browsers</span>
<span>This Flash video player is particular about security, so it won&rsquo;t play videos from a local</span>
<span>file system, only from a web server, so I have supplied a file on the Web (at</span>
<span>tinyurl.com/html5video-mp4</span>
<span>) for this example to play.</span>
<span>Here are the argument s to supply to the</span>
<span>flashvars</span>
<span>attribute of the</span>
<span>&lt;param&gt;</span>
<span>element:</span>
<span>url</span>
<span>A URL on a web server of a</span>
<span>.mp4</span>
<span>file to play.</span>
<span>autoPlay</span>
<span>If</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>, plays automatically; otherwise, waits for the Play button to be clicked.</span>
<span>autoBuffering</span>
<span>If</span>
<span>true</span>
<span>, in order to minimize buffering later on with slow connections, before it starts</span>
<span>playing, the video will be preloaded sufficiently for the available bandwidth.</span>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<span>Using the information in this chapter, you will be able to embed any audio and video</span>
