  PHP has come a long way since its birth in the mid-1990&apos;s.
  From humble beginnings to becoming one of the most prominent
  languages powering the web, the evolution of PHP is a geek&apos;s
  fairy tale.  Mind you, such explosive growth was no easy
  task. Those of you interested in briefly seeing how PHP grew

  a piece of Internet history, you can find old releases of
  PHP in the <a href="http://museum.php.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;PHP Museum</a>.
