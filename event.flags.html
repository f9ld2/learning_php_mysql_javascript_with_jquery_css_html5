 <h1>Event flags</h1>

 <p class="para">
  <strong><code>Event::READ</code></strong>
  This flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided file
  descriptor (usually a stream resource, or socket) is ready for reading.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <strong><code>Event::WRITE</code></strong>
  flag indicates an event that becomes active when the provided file
  descriptor (usually a stream resource, or socket) is ready for writing.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <strong><code>Event::SIGNAL</code></strong>
  used to implement signal detection. See &quot;Constructing signal events&quot; below.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <strong><code>Event::TIMEOUT</code></strong>
  indicates an event that becomes active after a timeout elapses. The
  <strong><code>Event::TIMEOUT</code></strong>
  flag is ignored when constructing an event: one can either set a timeout
  when event is
  <em class="emphasis">added</em>
  , or not. It is set in the
  <em>$what</em>
  argument to the callback function when a timeout has occurred.
