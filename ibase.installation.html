  To enable Firebird/InterBase support configure PHP

  Firebird/InterBase base install directory, which defaults to

   In order for this extension to work, there are
<acronym title="Dynamic Link Library">DLL</acronym> files that must be available to the Windows
system <span class="envar">PATH</span>. For information on how to do this, see the
<acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym> entitled &quot;<a href="faq.installation.html#faq.installation.addtopath" class="link">How do I add my PHP directory to the PATH

files from the PHP folder into the Windows system directory also works
(because the system directory is by default in the system&apos;s
<span class="envar">PATH</span>), this is not recommended.

   If you installed the Firebird/InterBase database server on the
   same machine PHP is running on, you will have this DLL already and
   <var class="filename">fbclient.dll,gds32.dll</var> (gds32.dll is generated from the installer for legacy applications) will already be in 
   the <span class="envar">PATH</span>.
