  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
   <span class="simpara">
    As of PHP 4.3.2, <span class="envar">PATH_TRANSLATED</span> is no longer set 
    implicitly under the Apache 2 <acronym title="Server Application Programming Interface">SAPI</acronym> in contrast 
    to the situation in Apache 1, where it&apos;s set to the same value as 
    the <span class="envar">SCRIPT_FILENAME</span> server variable when it&apos;s not 
    populated by Apache.  This change was made to comply with the 
    <acronym title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</acronym> specification that 
    <span class="envar">PATH_TRANSLATED</span> should only exist if 
    <span class="envar">PATH_INFO</span> is defined.
   </span>
   <span class="simpara">
    Apache 2 users may use <em>AcceptPathInfo = On</em> inside
    <var class="filename">httpd.conf</var> to define <span class="envar">PATH_INFO</span>.
   </span>
