   is an event loop: one registers interest in certain events (such as a file
   descriptor being readable or a timeout occurring), and it will manage these
   event sources and provide the program with events.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   To do this, it must take more or less complete control over the process (or
   thread) by executing the event loop handler, and will then communicate
   events via a callback mechanism.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   You register interest in certain events by registering so-called event
   watchers, and then hand it over to libev by starting the watcher.
