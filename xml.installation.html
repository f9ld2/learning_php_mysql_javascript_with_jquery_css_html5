  This extension is enabled by default. It may be disabled by using the following option at compile time: 
  <strong class="option configure">--disable-xml</strong>

  These functions are enabled by default, using the bundled expat library.
  You can disable XML support with
  <strong class="option configure">--disable-xml</strong>
.
  If you compile PHP as a module for Apache 1.3.9 or later, PHP will
  automatically use the bundled <span class="productname">expat</span> library from
  Apache. If you don&apos;t want to use the bundled expat library, configure
  PHP with <strong class="option configure">--with-expat-dir=DIR</strong>
, where DIR should
  point to the base installation directory of expat.
 </p>
 <p class="simpara">The Windows version of PHP has built-in
support for this extension. You do not need to load any additional
extensions in order to use these functions.</p>
