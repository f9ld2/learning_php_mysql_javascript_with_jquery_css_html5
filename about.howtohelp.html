   The PHP manual is translated into many languages. Knowing English and a
   foreign language allows for another way to help improve the PHP manual by
   working with a translation team. For information about starting a new 
   translation, or helping a currently translated version, please read
   <a href="http://doc.php.net/tutorial/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://doc.php.net/tutorial/</a>.

  <p class="para">
   The PHP Documentation Project also has an IRC channel where many manual
   authors hang out. Stop by <em>#php.doc</em> on
   <em>irc.efnet.org</em> and discuss ways to improve
   the PHP documentation.
