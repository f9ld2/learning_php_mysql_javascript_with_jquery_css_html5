  <h2 class="title">Arrays and Array-style COM properties</h2>
  <p class="para">
   Many COM objects expose their properties as arrays, or using array-style
   access.  In PHP 4, you may use PHP array syntax to read/write such a
   property, but only a single dimension is allowed.  If  you want to read a
   multi-dimensional property, you could instead make the property access
   into a function call, with each parameter representing each dimension of
   the array access, but there is no way to write to such a property.

   PHP 5 introduces the following new features to make your life easier:
   <ul class="itemizedlist">

      Access multi-dimensional arrays, or COM properties that require
      multiple parameters using PHP array syntax.  You can also write or set
      properties using this technique.

      Iterate SafeArrays (&quot;true&quot; arrays) using the <a href="control-structures.foreach.html" class="link">foreach</a> control structure.  
      This works because SafeArrays include information about their size.  If an
      array-style property implements IEnumVariant then you can also use
      foreach for that property too; take a look at <a href="com.examples.foreach.html" class="xref">For Each</a> for more information on this topic.
