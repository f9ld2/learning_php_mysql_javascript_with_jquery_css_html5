  <p class="para">
   To the best of our knowledge, the first article about PHP in
   a hard-copy magazine was published in the Czech mutation of
   Computerworld in the spring of 1998, and covered PHP 3.0. As with
   books, this was the first in a series of many articles published
   about PHP in various prominent magazines.
