 <h1>Incompatibilities</h1>

 <p class="para">
  MySQL Native Driver is in most cases compatible with MySQL Client Library
  (<em>libmysql</em>). This section documents incompatibilities
  between these libraries.

 <ul class="itemizedlist">

   <p class="para">
    Values of <em>bit</em> data type are returned as binary strings
    (e.g. &quot;\0&quot; or &quot;\x1F&quot;) with <em>libmysql</em> and as decimal
    strings (e.g. &quot;0&quot; or &quot;31&quot;) with <em>mysqlnd</em>. If you want the
    code to be compatible with both libraries then always return bit fields as
    numbers from MySQL with a query like this:
    <em>SELECT bit + 0 FROM table</em>.
   </p>

 </ul>
