  In order to have these functions available, you must compile PHP with
  fbsql support by using the
  <strong class="option configure">--with-fbsql[=DIR]</strong>
 option. If you use
  this option without specifying the path to fbsql, PHP will search for the
  fbsql client libraries in the default installation location for the
  platform. Users who installed FrontBase in a non standard directory should
  always specify the path to fbsql:
  <strong class="option configure">--with-fbsql=/path/to/fbsql</strong>
. This will
  force PHP to use the client libraries installed by FrontBase, avoiding any
  conflicts.
