   <h2 class="title">CLI and CGI</h2>
   <p class="para">
    In PHP 5 there were some changes in CLI and CGI filenames. In PHP 5, the
    CGI version was renamed to <var class="filename">php-cgi.exe</var> (previously
    <var class="filename">php.exe</var>) and the CLI version now sits in the main
    directory (previously <var class="filename">cli/php.exe</var>).
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    In PHP 5 it was also introduced a new mode:
    <var class="filename">php-win.exe</var>. This is equal to the CLI version, except
    that php-win doesn&apos;t output anything and thus provides no console (no &quot;dos
    box&quot; appears on the screen). This behavior is similar to php-gtk.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    In PHP 5, the CLI version will always populate the global 
    <var class="varname"><var class="varname"><a href="reserved.variables.argv.html" class="classname">$argv</a></var></var> and <var class="varname"><var class="varname"><a href="reserved.variables.argc.html" class="classname">$argc</a></var></var> variables regardless
    of any <var class="filename">php.ini</var> directive setting.  Even having  
    <a href="ini.core.html#ini.register-argc-argv" class="link">register_argc_argv</a> set to
    <em>off</em> will have no affect in CLI.
