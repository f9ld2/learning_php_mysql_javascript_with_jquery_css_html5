    <p class="simpara">
     If your server does not have any content that is not restricted
     by password or ip based access control, there is no need for
     these configuration options.  If your web server does not allow
     you to do redirects, or the server does not have a way to
     communicate to the PHP binary that the request is a safely
     redirected request, you can specify the option <a href="configure.about.html#configure.enable-force-cgi-redirect" class="link">--enable-force-cgi-redirect</a>
     to the configure script.  You still have to make sure your PHP
     scripts do not rely on one or another way of calling the script,
     neither by directly <var class="filename">http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/dir/script.php</var>
     nor by redirection <var class="filename">http://my.host/dir/script.php</var>.
    </p>
    <p class="simpara">
     Redirection can be configured in Apache by using AddHandler and
     Action directives (see below).
