 <h1>About event persistence</h1>

 <p class="para">
  By default, whenever a pending event becomes active (because its file
  descriptor is ready to read or write, or because its timeout expires), it
  becomes non-pending right before its callback is executed. Thus, to make the
  event pending again one may call
  <span class="methodname"><a href="event.add.html" class="methodname">Event::add()</a></span>
  on it again from inside the callback function.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  If the
  <strong><code>Event::PERSIST</code></strong>
  flag is set on an event, however, the event is
  <em class="emphasis">persistent</em>
  . This means that event remains pending even when its callback is activated.
  <span class="methodname"><a href="event.del.html" class="methodname">Event::del()</a></span>
  method can be called to make it non-pending.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The timeout on a persistent event resets whenever the event&apos;s callback runs.
  Thus, if one has an event with flags
  <strong><code>Event::READ</code></strong>
  <em>|</em>
  <strong><code>Event::PERSIST</code></strong>
  and a timeout of five seconds, the event will become active:

   <p class="para">
    Whenever the socket or file descriptor is ready for reading.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Whenever five seconds have passed since the event last became active.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
