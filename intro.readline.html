   The readline functions implement an interface
   to the GNU Readline library. These are functions that provide
   editable command lines. An example being the way Bash allows you
   to use the arrow keys to insert characters or scroll through
   command history. Because of the interactive nature of this
   library, it will be of little use for writing Web applications,
   but may be useful when writing scripts used from a

    The readline extension is not thread-safe! Thus, the usage of it with any
    true thread safe SAPI (like Apache mod_winnt) is strongly discouraged.
