   The swish extension provides the bindings for Swish-e API.
   Swish-e stands for &quot;Simple Web Indexing System for Humans - Enhanced&quot; and
   is an open source system for indexing and search.
   Swish-e itself is licensed under GPL license, but uses a clause that
   allows applications to link against the library if every copy of the
   combined work is accompanied by the URL to Swish-e source code. Here it
   is: <a href="http://swish-e.org/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://swish-e.org</a>.
