  Some trader functions provide different results depending of the &quot;starting point&quot; of the data being involved. This is often referred as a function having memories. An example of such function is the Exponential Moving Average. It is possible to control the unstable period (the amount of data to strip off) using <a href="function.trader-set-unstable-period.html" class="link">trader_set_unstable_period()</a> function.
