   These functions are intended to work with <a href="http://mhash.sourceforge.net/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;mhash</a>. Mhash can be used to create checksums,
   message digests, message authentication codes, and more.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This is an interface to the mhash library. Mhash supports a wide
   variety of hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, GOST, and many
   others. For a complete list of supported hashes, refer to the
   <a href="mhash.constants.html" class="link">constants page</a>. The general rule is that you can access
   the hash algorithm from PHP with <strong><code>MHASH_hashname</code></strong>. For example, to
   access TIGER you use the PHP constant <strong><code>MHASH_TIGER</code></strong>.
