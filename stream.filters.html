 <h1>Stream Filters</h1>

 <p class="simpara">
  A <em>filter</em> is a final piece of code which may perform
  operations on data as it is being read from or written to a stream.
  Any number of filters may be stacked onto a stream. Custom
  filters can be defined in a PHP script using
  <span class="function"><a href="function.stream-filter-register.html" class="function">stream_filter_register()</a></span> or in an extension using the
  API Reference in <a href="internals2.streams.html" class="xref">Working with streams</a>.  To access the list of currently 
  registered filters, use <span class="function"><a href="function.stream-get-filters.html" class="function">stream_get_filters()</a></span>.
