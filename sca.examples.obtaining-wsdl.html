  <h2 class="title">Obtaining the WSDL for an SCA component offering a Service as
   a Web service </h2>
  
  <p class="para"> 
   SCA components that expose a Web service interface (i.e. have
   an @binding.soap annotation) will return their WSDL definition in
   response to an HTTP request with a get parameter of &quot;wsdl&quot;. The usual
   way to obtain this is with &quot;?wsdl&quot; on the end of a URL. The example
   below uses
   <span class="function"><a href="function.file-get-contents.html" class="function">file_get_contents()</a></span> to obtain WSDL from a
   service and writes it to a temporary file before then obtaining a
   proxy for the service in the usual way. You could of course also
   obtain the WSDL in a browser, or by some other means, and save the file
   yourself.
