  A great place to start is by reading about <span class="function"><a href="phar.buildfromiterator.html" class="function">Phar::buildFromIterator()</a></span>,
  and the specifics of the <a href="phar.fileformat.html" class="link">file format</a> choices
  available for archives.  A healthy understanding of what a stub is and does is crucial
  to phar archive creation, and so <span class="function"><a href="phar.setstub.html" class="function">Phar::setStub()</a></span> and
  <span class="function"><a href="phar.createdefaultstub.html" class="function">Phar::createDefaultStub()</a></span> are good places to start as well.
  If you are distributing a web-based application, it is crucial to know about
  <span class="function"><a href="phar.webphar.html" class="function">Phar::webPhar()</a></span> and related method
  <span class="function"><a href="phar.mungserver.html" class="function">Phar::mungServer()</a></span>.  Any application that accesses
  its own files should also consider using <span class="function"><a href="phar.interceptfilefuncs.html" class="function">Phar::interceptFileFuncs()</a></span>.
