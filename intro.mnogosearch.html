   These functions allow you to access the mnoGoSearch (former
   UdmSearch) free search engine. mnoGoSearch is a full-featured search
   engine software for intranet and internet servers, distributed under the
   GNU license. mnoGoSearch has a number of unique features, which makes it
   appropriate for a wide range of applications from search within your
   site to a specialized search system such as cooking recipes or newspaper
   search, FTP archive search, news articles search, etc. It offers
   full-text indexing and searching for HTML, PDF, and text documents.
   mnoGoSearch consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
   (indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS
   servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and
   storing meta-data about that documents in an SQL database in a smart and
   effective manner. After every document is referenced by its
   corresponding URL, meta-data is collected by the indexer for later use
   in a search process. The search is performed via Web interface. C, CGI,
   PHP and Perl search front ends are included.
