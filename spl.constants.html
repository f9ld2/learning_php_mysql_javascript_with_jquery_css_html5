 <h1>Predefined Constants</h1>

 <p class="simpara">
The constants below are defined by this extension, and
will only be available when the extension has either
been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
</p>
 <div class="warning"><strong class="warning">Warning</strong>
  <p class="para">
   SPL uses class constants since PHP 5.1. Prior releases use global constants
   in the form <strong><code>RIT_LEAVES_ONLY</code></strong>.
