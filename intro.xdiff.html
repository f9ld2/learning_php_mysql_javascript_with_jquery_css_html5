   xdiff extension enables you to create and apply patch files containing
   differences between different revisions of files.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This extension supports two modes of operation - on strings and on files, as well
   as two different patch formats - unified and binary. Unified patches are excellent
   for text files as they are human-readable and easy to review. For binary files like
   archives or images, binary patches will be adequate choice as they are binary safe and
   handle non-printable characters well.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Starting from version 1.5.0 there are two different sets of functions for generating
   binary patches. New functions - <span class="function"><a href="function.xdiff-string-rabdiff.html" class="function">xdiff_string_rabdiff()</a></span> and 
   <span class="function"><a href="function.xdiff-file-rabdiff.html" class="function">xdiff_file_rabdiff()</a></span> generate output compatible with older functions
   but are typically faster and generate smaller results. For more details about methods of
   generating binary patches and differences between them, please check

  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This extension uses libxdiff to implement these functions. Please see
