   The PHP safe mode is an attempt to solve the shared-server security
   problem. It is architecturally incorrect to try to solve this
   problem at the PHP level, but since the alternatives at the web
   server and OS levels aren&apos;t very realistic, many people,
   especially ISP&apos;s, use safe mode for now.
