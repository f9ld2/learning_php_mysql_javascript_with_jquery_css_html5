 <h1>Using the PHP LDAP calls</h1>

 <p class="para">
  Before you can use the LDAP calls you will need to know ..
  <ul class="itemizedlist">
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     The name or address of the directory server you will use
    </p>
   </li>
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     The &quot;base dn&quot; of the server (the part of the world directory
     that is held on this server, which could be &quot;o=My
     Company,c=US&quot;)
    </p>
   </li>
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     Whether you need a password to access the server (many servers
     will provide read access for an &quot;anonymous bind&quot; but require a
     password for anything else)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </p>

 <p class="para">
  The typical sequence of LDAP calls you will make in an
  application will follow this pattern:
<pre class="literallayout">
  ldap_connect()    // establish connection to server
     |
  ldap_bind()       // anonymous or authenticated &quot;login&quot;
     |
  do something like search or update the directory
  and display the results
     |
  ldap_close()      // &quot;logout&quot;
</pre>
 </p>
