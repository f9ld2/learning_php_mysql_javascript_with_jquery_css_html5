   The <em>PHP Data Objects</em> (<acronym>PDO</acronym>) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface
   for accessing databases in PHP. Each database driver that
   implements the PDO interface can expose database-specific
   features as regular extension functions. Note that you cannot
   perform any database functions using the PDO extension by
   itself; you must use a <a href="pdo.drivers.html" class="link">database-specific
   PDO driver</a> to access a database server.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   PDO provides a <em class="emphasis">data-access</em> abstraction layer, which
   means that, regardless of which database you&apos;re using, you use the same
   functions to issue queries and fetch data.  PDO does
   <em class="emphasis">not</em> provide a <em class="emphasis">database</em>
   abstraction; it doesn&apos;t rewrite SQL or emulate missing features.  You
   should use a full-blown abstraction layer if you need that facility.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   PDO ships with PHP 5.1, and is available as a PECL extension for PHP 5.0;
   PDO requires the new OO features in the core of PHP 5, and so will not
   run with earlier versions of PHP.
