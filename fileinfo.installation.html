  This extension is enabled by default as of PHP 5.3.0. Before this time,
  fileinfo was a PECL extension but is no longer maintained there.
  However, versions prior to 5.3+ may use the
  <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/fileinfo" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;discontinued PECL extension</a>.

 <p class="para">
  Windows users must include the bundled <var class="filename">php_fileinfo.dll</var>
  <acronym title="Dynamic Link Library">DLL</acronym> file in <var class="filename">php.ini</var> to enable this extension.

 <p class="para">
  The libmagic library is bundled with PHP, but includes PHP specific changes.
  A patch against libmagic named <var class="filename">libmagic.patch</var> is maintained
  and may be found within the PHP fileinfo extensions source.
