  <h2 class="title">Comments</h2>
  <p class="para">
   The  sequence  (?#  marks  the  start  of  a  comment  which
   continues   up  to  the  next  closing  parenthesis.  Nested
   parentheses are not permitted. The characters that make up a
   comment play no part in the pattern matching at all.

  <p class="para">
   If the <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_EXTENDED</a>
   option is set, an unescaped # character outside  a character class
   introduces a comment that continues up to the next newline character
   in the pattern.
