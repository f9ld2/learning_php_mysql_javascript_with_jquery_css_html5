   PHP contains built-in MySQL access library, which can be used to
   access MySQL. It is known that mnoGoSearch is not compatible with
   this built-in library and can work only with generic MySQL
   libraries. Thus, if you use mnoGoSearch with MySQL, during PHP
   configuration you have to indicate the directory of your MySQL
   installation, that was used during mnoGoSearch configuration, i.e. for
   example:
   <strong class="option configure">--with-mnogosearch --with-mysql=/usr</strong>
.
