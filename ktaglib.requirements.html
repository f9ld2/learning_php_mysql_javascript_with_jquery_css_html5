If you want to build ktaglib you need at least taglib 1.5 installed. To obtain the taglib see the <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;taglib project page</a>.
Windows DLL&apos;s are build static against taglib, therefore there is no need to have taglib installed.
