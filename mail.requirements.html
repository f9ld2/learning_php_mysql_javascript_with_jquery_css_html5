   For the Mail functions to be available, PHP must have access to the
   <em>sendmail</em> binary on your system during compile time.
   If you use another mail program, such as <span class="productname">qmail</span>
   or <span class="productname">postfix</span>, be sure to
   use the appropriate sendmail wrappers that come with them.  PHP will
   first look for sendmail in your <span class="envar">PATH</span>, and then in
   the following:
   <em>/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/etc:/etc:/usr/ucblib:/usr/lib</em>.
   It&apos;s highly recommended to have sendmail available from your
   <span class="envar">PATH</span>.  Also, the user that compiled PHP must have
   permission to access the sendmail binary.
