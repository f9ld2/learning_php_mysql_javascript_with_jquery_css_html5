 <p class="para">
  To use PHP&apos;s cURL support you must also compile PHP <strong class="option configure">--with-curl[=DIR]</strong>
 where DIR is the
  location of the directory containing the <var class="filename">lib</var> and <var class="filename">include</var>
  directories. In the <var class="filename">include</var> directory there should be a folder
  named <var class="filename">curl</var> which should contain the <var class="filename">easy.h</var> and
  <var class="filename">curl.h</var> files. There should be a file named 
  <var class="filename">libcurl.a</var> located in the <var class="filename">lib</var> directory. Beginning
  with PHP 4.3.0 you can configure PHP to use cURL for URL streams
  <strong class="option configure">--with-curlwrappers</strong>
.
  This feature was moved to PECL as of PHP 5.5.0.
