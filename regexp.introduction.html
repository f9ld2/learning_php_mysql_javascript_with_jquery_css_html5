   The syntax and semantics of  the  regular  expressions
   supported  by PCRE are described below. Regular expressions are
   also described in the Perl documentation and in a number  of
   other  books,  some  of which have copious examples. Jeffrey
   Friedl&apos;s  &quot;Mastering  Regular  Expressions&quot;,  published   by
   O&apos;Reilly  (ISBN 1-56592-257-3), covers them in great detail.
   The description here is intended as reference documentation.

   A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against  a
   subject string from left to right. Most characters stand for
   themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding
   characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the pattern
   <em>The quick brown fox</em>
   matches a portion of a subject string that is  identical  to
   itself.
