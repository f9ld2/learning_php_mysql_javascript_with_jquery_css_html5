 <h1>Running the Driver&apos;s Tests</h1>


 <p class="para">
  The PECL package does not come with the tests, but they are available at 
  <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver-legacy" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;Github</a>.

 <div class="section">
  <h2 class="title">.phpt Tests</h2>
  <p class="para">
   .phpt tests are the standard way of testing PHP extensions. After compiling
   the MongoDB driver with &quot;make&quot; you can then issue &quot;make test&quot; to run the
   tests. These tests require MongoDB to be working, and hence, you need to
   configure the test suite itself.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   There is more information on running the tests in the contributing
   guidelines on 
   <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-tests" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;GitHub</a>.
