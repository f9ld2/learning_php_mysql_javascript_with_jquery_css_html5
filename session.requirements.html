    Optionally you can use shared memory allocation (mm), developed by
    Ralf S. Engelschall, for session storage. You have to download
    <a href="http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/mm/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;mm</a> and install it. This option is not
    available for Windows platforms. Note that the session storage module
    for mm does not guarantee that concurrent accesses to the same session
    are properly locked. It might be more appropriate to use a shared memory
    based filesystem (such as tmpfs on Solaris/Linux, or <var class="filename">/dev/md</var> on BSD) to
    store sessions in files, because they are properly locked.
    Session data is stored in memory thus web server restart deletes it.
