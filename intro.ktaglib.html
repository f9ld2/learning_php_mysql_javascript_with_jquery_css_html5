    KTaglib is an object oriented binding to the taglib library from the KDE project used in projects like Amarok to read and write ID3 and Ogg tags.
    The library also provides access to audio information. The bindings are designed usually follow the underlying C++ API, but were changed whenever
    there is a more PHP-like way.
