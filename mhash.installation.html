 <h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
 <p class="para">
  You need to compile PHP with the
  <strong class="option configure">--with-mhash[=DIR]</strong>
 parameter to enable
  this extension. DIR is the mhash installation directory.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  As of PHP 5.3.0, the mhash extension is emulated thru the 
  <a href="ref.hash.html" class="link">Hash</a> extension. This makes
  the mhash installation directory have no effect, and requires
  the hash extension enabled to make the mhash support available.
