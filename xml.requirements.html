  <h2 class="title">Requirements</h2>
  <p class="para">This extension requires the
<a href="book.libxml.html" class="link">libxml</a> PHP extension. This means that passing in
<strong class="option configure">--enable-libxml</strong>
 is also required, although this is implicitly accomplished
because libxml is enabled by default.</p>
  <p class="para">
   This extension uses an <span class="productname">expat compat layer</span> by
   default. It can use also <span class="productname">expat</span>, which can
   be found at <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html</a>.  The
   Makefile that comes with <span class="productname">expat</span> does not build a library by
   default, you can use this make rule for that:
   <div class="example-contents">
<div class="makefilecode"><pre class="makefilecode">libexpat.a: $(OBJS)
    ar -rc $@ $(OBJS)
    ranlib $@</pre>
</div>
   </div>

   A source RPM package of expat can be found at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/" class="link external">&#xBB;&#xA0;http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/</a>.
