   The calendar extension presents a series of functions to simplify
   converting between different calendar formats.  The intermediary or
   standard it is based on is the Julian Day Count.  The Julian Day Count is
   a count of days starting from January 1st, 4713 B.C.  To convert between
   calendar systems, you must first convert to Julian Day Count, then to the
   calendar system of your choice.  Julian Day Count is very different from
   the Julian Calendar! For more information on Julian Day Count, visit
