  <h2 class="title"> Deploying an SCA component </h2>
  <p class="para"> 
   There are no special steps needed to deploy a PHP SCA
   component. It is sufficient to place the component PHP script in its
   proper place under the web server document root, just like any other
   PHP script. It is the
   <span class="function"><strong>SCA::initComponent()</strong></span> executable line
   within each component that will be executed whenever the script is
   called, and which will be responsible for making the component
   respond appropriately to Web service calls, local calls, or
   requests for WSDL.
