  <h2 class="title">About user notes</h2>
  <p class="para">
   The user-contributed notes play an important role in the development of
   this manual. By allowing readers of the manual to contribute examples,
   caveats, and further clarifications from their browser, we are able to
   incorporate that feedback into the main text of the manual. And until the
   notes have been incorporated, they may be viewed in their submitted form
   online, and in some of the offline formats.

  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
   </p><p class="para">
    The user-contributed notes are not moderated before they appear online, so
    the quality of the writing or code examples, and even the veracity of the
    contribution, cannot be guaranteed. (Not that there is any guarantee of
    the quality or accuracy of the manual text itself.)
