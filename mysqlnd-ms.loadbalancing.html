  <p class="para">
   Four load balancing strategies are supported to distribute
   statements over the configured MySQL slave servers:

  <p class="para">
   <dl>

    
     <dt>
random</dt>

     <dd>

      <p class="para">
       Chooses a random server whenever a statement is executed.
      </p>
     </dd>

    
    
     <dt>
random once (default)</dt>

     <dd>

      <p class="para">
       Chooses a random server after the first statement is executed,
       and uses the decision for the rest of the PHP request.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
       It is the default, and the lowest impact on the connection state.
      </p>
     </dd>

    
    
     <dt>
round robin</dt>

     <dd>

      <p class="para">
       Iterates over the list of configured servers.

  <p class="para">
   Servers can be prioritized assigning a weight. A server that has been given
   a weight of two will get twice as many requests as a server that has been
   given the default weight of one. Prioritization can be handy in heterogenous
   environments. For example, you may want to assign more requests to
   a powerful machine than to a less powerful. Or, you may have configured
   servers that are close or far from the client, thus expose different latencies.
