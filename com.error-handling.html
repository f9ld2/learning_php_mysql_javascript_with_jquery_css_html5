  This extension will throw instances of the class <em>com_exception</em>
  whenever there is a potentially fatal error reported by COM.  All
  COM exceptions have a well-defined <em>code</em> property that
  corresponds to the HRESULT return value from the various COM operations.
  You may use this code to make programmatic decisions on how to handle the
  exception.
