  <h1>Request Injection Attacks</h1>

  <p class="para">
   If you are passing <em>$_GET</em> (or <em>$_POST</em>)
   parameters to your queries, make sure that they are cast to strings first.
   Users can insert associative arrays in GET and POST requests, which could
   then become unwanted $-queries.
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   A fairly innocuous example: suppose you are looking up a user&apos;s information
   with the request <em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com?username=bob</em>.
   Your application creates the query
   <em>$q = new \MongoDB\Driver\Query( [ &apos;username&apos; =&gt; $_GET[&apos;username&apos;] ])</em>.
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   Someone could subvert this by getting
   <em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com?username[$ne]=foo</em>, which PHP
   will magically turn into an associative array, turning your query into
   <em>$q = new \MongoDB\Driver\Query( [ &apos;username&apos; =&gt; [ &apos;$ne&apos; =&gt; &apos;foo&apos; ] ] )</em>,
   which will return all users not named &quot;foo&quot; (all of your users, probably).
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   This is a fairly easy attack to defend against: make sure $_GET and $_POST
   parameters are the type you expect before you send them to the database.
   PHP has the <span class="function"><a href="function.filter-var.html" class="function">filter_var()</a></span> function to assist with this.
  </p>

  <p class="para">
   Note that this type of attack can be used with any database interaction that
   locates a document, including updates, upserts, deletes, and findAndModify
   commands.
