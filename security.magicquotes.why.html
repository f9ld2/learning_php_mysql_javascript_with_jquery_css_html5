    <h2 class="title">Why did we use Magic Quotes</h2>
    <div class="warning"><strong class="warning">Warning</strong><p class="simpara">This feature has been
<em class="emphasis">DEPRECATED</em> as of PHP 5.3.0 and <em class="emphasis">REMOVED</em>
as of PHP 5.4.0.</p></div>
    <ul class="itemizedlist">
     <li class="listitem">
      <span class="simpara">
       There is no reason to use magic quotes because they are no longer
       a supported part of <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>. However, they did exist and did help a
       few beginners blissfully and unknowingly write better (more secure)
       code. But, when dealing with code that relies upon this behavior
       it&apos;s better to update the code instead of turning magic quotes on.

      <span class="simpara">
       So why did this feature exist? Simple, to help prevent
       <a href="security.database.sql-injection.html" class="link">SQL Injection</a>.
       Today developers are better aware of security and end up using
       database specific escaping mechanisms and/or prepared statements
       instead of relying upon features like magical quotes.
