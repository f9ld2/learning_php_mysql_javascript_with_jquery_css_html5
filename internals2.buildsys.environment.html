  <h2 class="title">Building PHP for extension development</h2>
  <p class="para">
   In a typical PHP installation, the need for high performance almost always
   results in optimization at the cost of debugging facilities. This is a
   reasonable tradeoff for production use, but when developing an extension it
   falls short. What we need is a build of PHP which will give us some hints
   what has gone wrong when something does.
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   The Zend Engine provides a memory manager which is capable of tracking
   memory leaks in extensions and providing detailed debugging information.
   This tracking is disabled by default, as is thread-safety. To turn them
   on, pass the <strong class="option configure">--enable-debug</strong>
 and
   <em>--enable-maintainer-zts</em> options to
   <var class="filename">configure</var>, along with whatever options you typically
   use. For instructions on building PHP from source, see the instructions at
   <a href="install.general.html" class="xref">General Installation Considerations</a>. A typical <var class="filename">configure</var>
   line might look like this:
   <div class="example-contents">
<div class="shellcode"><pre class="shellcode">$ ./configure --prefix=/where/to/install/php --enable-debug --enable-maintainer-zts --enable-cgi --enable-cli --with-mysql=/path/to/mysql</pre>
</div>
   </div>
