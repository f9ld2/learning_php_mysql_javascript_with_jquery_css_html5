   <h2 class="title">What References Are</h2>
   <p class="simpara">
    References in PHP are a means to access the same variable content
    by different names. They are not like C pointers; for instance,
    you cannot perform pointer arithmetic using them, they are not
    actual memory addresses, and so on. See
    <a href="language.references.arent.html" class="xref">What References Are Not</a> for more
    information. Instead, they are symbol table aliases. Note that in
    PHP, variable name and variable content are different, so the same
    content can have different names.  The closest analogy is with
    Unix filenames and files - variable names are directory entries,
    while variable content is the file itself. References can be
    likened to hardlinking in Unix filesystem.
