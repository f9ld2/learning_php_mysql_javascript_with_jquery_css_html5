  <p class="simpara">
   This extension aims to provide an interface for communicating with IBMs
   WebSphere MQ series Queue managers.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   The interface mimics the C-API client interface of WebSphere MQ Series as
   close as possible. Using the same naming conventions and possibilities of the
   C-API. In order to understand the workings of this extension some level of
   understanding the C-API is required.

   For MQ-options, MQ-structures, MQ-results etc. please read the WebSphere MQ
   Application Programming Guide and WebSphere MQ Application Programming
   Reference.
