    This extension has been deprecated as the PECL extension

   The functions in this module try to guess the content type
   and encoding of a file by looking for certain 
   <em class="emphasis">magic</em> byte sequences at specific
   positions within the file. While this is not a bullet proof
   approach the heuristics used do a very good job.

   This extension is derived from Apache mod_mime_magic, 
   which is itself based on the <var class="filename">file</var> 
   command maintained by Ian F. Darwin. See the source code for
   further historic and copyright information.
